18	savings-and-loan
19	bailout
20	agency
21	can
22	raise
23	capital
24	,

32	's
33	sale

10	(

22	from

1	The

31	,

37	.

1	The
2	complex
3	financing
4	plan
5	in
6	the
7	S&L
8	bailout
9	law
10	includes
11	raising
12	$
13	30
14	billion
15	from
16	debt
17	issued
18	by
19	the
20	newly
21	created
22	RTC
23	.

1	This
2	financing
3	system
4	was
5	created
6	in
7	the
8	new
9	law
10	in
11	order
12	to
13	keep
14	the
15	bailout
16	spending
17	from
18	swelling
19	the
20	budget
21	deficit
22	.

1	Another
2	$
3	20
4	billion
5	would
6	be
7	raised
8	through
9	Treasury
10	bonds
11	,
12	which
13	pay
14	lower
15	interest
16	rates
17	.

1	But
2	the
3	RTC
4	also
5	requires
6	``
7	working
8	''
9	capital
10	to
11	maintain
12	the
13	bad
14	assets
15	of
16	thrifts
17	that
18	are
19	sold
20	,
21	until
22	the
23	assets
24	can
25	be
26	sold
27	separately
28	.

1	That
2	debt
3	would
4	be
5	paid
6	off
7	as
8	the
9	assets
10	are
11	sold
12	,
13	leaving
14	the
15	total
16	spending
17	for
18	the

20	at

29	including
30	interest
31	over
32	10
33	years
34	.

1	``
2	It
3	's
4	a
5	problem
6	that
7	clearly
8	has
9	to
10	be

13	''
14	said
15	David
16	Cooke
17	,
18	executive
19	director
20	of
21	the
22	RTC
23	.

1	The
2	agency
3	has
4	already
5	spent
6	roughly
7	$
8	19
9	billion
10	selling
11	34
12	insolvent
13	S&Ls
14	,
15	and
16	it
17	is
18	likely
19	to
20	sell
21	or
22	merge
23	600
24	by
25	the
26	time
27	the
28	bailout
29	concludes
30	.

1	Absent
2	other
3	working
4	capital
5	,
6	he
7	said
8	,
9	the
10	RTC
11	would
12	be
13	forced
14	to
15	delay
16	other
17	thrift
18	resolutions
19	until
20	cash
21	could
22	be
23	raised
24	by
25	selling
26	the
27	bad
28	assets
29	.

1	``
2	We
3	would
4	have
5	to
6	wait
7	until
8	we
9	have
10	collected
11	on

15	we
16	can
17	move
18	forward
19	,
20	''
21	he
22	said
23	.

1	The
2	complicated
3	language
4	in
5	the
6	huge
7	new
8	law
9	has
10	muddied
11	the
12	fight
13	.

1	The
2	law
3	does
4	allow
5	the
6	RTC
7	to
8	borrow
9	from
10	the
11	Treasury
12	up
13	to
14	$
15	5
16	billion
17	at
18	any
19	time
20	.

1	Moreover
2	,
3	it
4	says
5	the
6	RTC
7	's
8	total
9	obligations
10	may
11	not
12	exceed
13	$
14	50
15	billion
16	,
17	but
18	that
19	figure
20	is
21	derived
22	after
23	including
24	notes
25	and
26	other
27	debt
28	,
29	and
30	subtracting
31	from
32	it
33	the
34	market
35	value
36	of
37	the
38	assets
39	the
40	RTC
41	holds
42	.

34	at

1	I
2	choose
3	to
4	believe
5	it
6	's
7	the
8	latter
9	,
10	although
11	it
12	probably
13	springs
14	from

16	fact
17	that
18	just
19	about
20	everyone
21	out
22	here
23	,
24	including
25	the
26	A

31	is
32	originally
33	from

35	else

2	it
3	to
4	say
5	that

10	New

27	it

47	only
48	the

50	would
51	bifurcate
52	their

54	.

1	Anyway
2	,
3	the

7	you
8	a

10	of

10	a

13	from

13	)
14	,
15	Mr.
16	Trump
17	criticized
18	the
19	bill
20	as
21	an
22	explicit
23	effort
24	to
25	thwart
26	his
27	bid
28	for

32	said
33	it
34	contributed

16	's
17	opposition
18	to
19	the
20	bill
21	``

1	Rep.
2	Oberstar
3	brushed
4	off
5	Mr.

7	's
8	allegations
9	as
10	an
11	``
12	excuse
13	for
14	his
15	own
16	deal
17	failing
18	.
19	''

1	He
2	also
3	said
4	the
5	fact
6	that
7	the
8	other
9	letter
10	had
11	n't
12	come
13	from

15	Secretary

25	in
26	the

28	's
29	position
30	.

1	Mr.
2	Oberstar
3	and
4	other
5	committee
6	members
7	repeatedly
8	stressed
9	that
10	the
11	legislation
12	was
13	n't
14	a
15	response
16	to
17	any
18	particular
19	market
20	situation
21	.

1	But
2	they
3	cited
4	the
5	UAL
6	and
7	AMR
8	examples
9	as
10	reasons
11	to
12	move
13	quickly
14	to
15	enact
16	this
17	legislation
18	.

1	Aides
2	both
3	in
4	the
5	House
6	and
7	Senate
8	said
9	the
10	withdrawal
11	of
12	the
13	Trump
14	bid
15	for
16	AMR
17	is
18	n't
19	likely
20	to
21	deflate
22	efforts
23	to
24	push
25	the
26	legislation
27	.

1	``
2	It
3	's
4	still
5	on
6	the
7	fast
8	track
9	and
10	we
11	still
12	want
13	to
14	do
15	it
16	,
17	''
18	said
19	one
20	Senate
21	aide
22	.

1	The
2	bill
3	is
4	aimed
5	at
6	addressing
7	the
8	concern
9	that
10	an
11	airline
12	might
13	sacrifice
14	costly
15	safety
16	measures
17	to
18	pay
19	off
20	the
21	debt
22	incurred
23	in
24	a
25	leveraged
26	buy-out
27	.

1	Currently
2	,
3	the
4	transportation
5	secretary
6	does
7	n't
8	have
9	clearly
10	established
11	authority
12	to
13	block
14	mergers
15	,
16	but
17	can
18	take
19	the
20	drastic
21	step
22	of
23	revoking
24	the
25	operating
26	certificate
27	of
28	any
29	carrier
30	the
31	official
32	considers
33	unfit
34	.

1	Supporters
2	of
3	the
4	legislation
5	view
6	the
7	bill
8	as
9	an
10	effort
11	to
12	add
13	stability
14	and
15	certainty
16	to
17	the
18	airline-acquisition
19	process
20	,
21	and
22	to
23	preserve
24	the
25	safety
26	and
27	fitness
28	of
29	the
30	industry
31	.

1	In
2	general
3	,
4	the
5	bill
6	would
7	give
8	the
9	Transportation
10	Department
11	a
12	30-day
13	review
14	period
15	before
16	15
17	%
18	or
19	more
20	of
21	the
22	voting
23	stock
24	of
25	a
26	major
27	U.S.
28	air
29	carrier
30	could
31	be
32	acquired
33	.

1	It
2	also
3	would
4	require
5	the
6	acquiring
7	party
8	to
9	notify
10	the
11	transportation
12	secretary
13	and
14	to
15	provide
16	all
17	information
18	relevant
19	to
20	determining
21	the
22	intent
23	of
24	the
25	acquisition
26	.

1	The
2	bill
3	would
4	allow
5	the
6	secretary
7	to
8	reject
9	a
10	buy-out
11	if
12	sufficient
13	information
14	has
15	n't
16	been
17	provided
18	,
19	or
20	if
21	the
22	buy-out
23	is
24	likely
25	to
26	weaken
27	the
28	carrier
29	financially
30	,
31	result
32	in
33	a
34	substantial
35	reduction
36	in
37	size
38	of
39	the
40	airline
41	through
42	disposal
43	of
44	assets
45	,
46	or
47	give
48	control
49	to
50	a
51	foreign
52	interest
53	.

1	If
2	more
3	information
4	is
5	needed
6	,
7	the
8	secretary
9	would
10	have
11	authority
12	to
13	extend
14	the
15	review
16	period
17	20
18	days
19	.

1	All
2	the
3	witnesses
4	,
5	both
6	congressmen
7	and
8	industry
9	experts
10	,
11	expressed
12	support
13	for
14	the
15	bill
16	in
17	order
18	to
19	prevent
20	profiteers
21	from
22	cashing
23	in
24	on
25	airline
26	profits
27	at
28	the
29	expense
30	of
31	safe
32	,
33	cost-effective
34	service
35	.

1	But
2	several
3	committee
4	members
5	disapproved
6	,
7	some
8	backing
9	Mr.
10	Trump
11	's
12	claim
13	that
14	the
15	threat
16	of
17	regulation
18	caused
19	the
20	failure
21	of
22	the
23	UAL
24	deal
25	and
26	the
27	stock-market
28	plunge
29	.

1	One
2	of
3	the
4	major
5	concerns
6	expressed
7	by
8	the
9	dissenters
10	was
11	that
12	large
13	airlines
14	would
15	be
16	prohibited
17	from
18	divesting
19	themselves
20	of
21	smaller
22	entities
23	and
24	producing
25	independent
26	spin-off
27	companies
28	.

1	In
2	a
3	possible
4	prelude
5	to
6	the
7	resumption
8	of

26	two
27	sides
28	will

30	with
31	him
32	tomorrow
33	.

1	``
2	It
3	could
4	be
5	a
6	long
7	meeting

10	could
11	be

13	short
14	one

16	''
17	said
18	Doug
19	Hammond
20	,
21	the
22	mediator
23	,
24	who
25	called
26	the
27	agreement
28	to
29	meet
30	a
31	first
32	step
33	toward
34	a
35	resumption
36	of
37	negotiations
38	.

1	``
2	We
3	're
4	encouraged

23	a
24	Boeing
25	spokesman
26	said
27	.

4	has

1	Added
2	another
3	executive
4	at
5	a
6	big
7	bank
8	:
9	``
10	We
11	were
12	all
13	a
14	little
15	goosey
16	over
17	the
18	weekend
19	trying
20	to
21	forecast
22	what
23	would
24	happen
25	{
26	Monday
27	}
28	,
29	but
30	it
31	's
32	been
33	very
34	quiet
35	.

1	Now
2	,
3	as
4	for
5	tomorrow
6	,
7	hell
8	,
9	who
10	knows
11	?

1	What
2	happened
3	Friday
4	shows
5	that
6	financial
7	markets
8	are
9	not
10	yet
11	sufficiently
12	coordinated
13	to
14	handle
15	another
16	meltdown
17	in
18	prices
19	.

1	No
2	fiddling
3	with
4	systems
5	and
6	procedures
7	will
8	ever
9	prevent
10	markets
11	from
12	suffering
13	a
14	panic
15	wave
16	of
17	selling
18	.

1	But
2	markets
3	can
4	operate
5	with
6	greater
7	or
8	lesser
9	efficiency
10	.

1	After
2	the
3	1987
4	plunge
5	,
6	markets
7	agreed
8	that
9	it
10	would
11	be
12	wise
13	to
14	halt
15	trading
16	whenever
17	panic
18	conditions
19	arose
20	.

1	The
2	New
3	York
4	Stock
5	Exchange
6	adopted
7	two
8	specific
9	circuit
10	breakers
11	:
12	If
13	the
14	Dow
15	Jones
16	index
17	falls
18	250
19	points
20	in
21	a
22	day
23	,
24	the
25	exchange
26	will
27	halt
28	trading
29	for
30	one
31	hour
32	;
33	if
34	the
35	decline
36	hits
37	400
38	points
39	,
40	the
41	exchange
42	will
43	close
44	for
45	an
46	additional
47	two
48	hours
49	.

1	The
2	rationale
3	is
4	that
5	an
6	interruption
7	of
8	trading
9	will
10	allow
11	investors
12	to
13	reconsider
14	their
15	strategies
16	,
17	calm
18	sellers
19	and
20	lead
21	buyers
22	to
23	enter
24	the
25	market
26	at
27	indicated
28	new
29	price
30	levels
31	.

1	It
2	is
3	impossible
4	to
5	know
6	whether
7	that
8	theory
9	is
10	realistic
11	.

1	A
2	temporary
3	cessation
4	of
5	trading
6	may
7	indeed
8	discourage
9	a
10	selling
11	panic
12	from
13	feeding
14	on
15	itself
16	.

1	But
2	there
3	is
4	also
5	the
6	possibility
7	that
8	shutting
9	down
10	markets
11	will
12	intensify
13	fears
14	and
15	cause
16	an
17	even
18	more
19	abrupt
20	slide
21	in
22	prices
23	.

1	What
2	happened
3	Friday
4	was
5	the
6	worst
7	of
8	all
9	worlds
10	.

1	The

1	The

2	the

1	Even
2	if
3	that
4	is
5	so
6	,
7	however
8	,
9	it
10	's
11	probably
12	the
13	case
14	that
15	no
16	barriers
17	should
18	have
19	been

1	The

7	word
8	spread
9	that
10	the
11	UAL
12	buy-out
13	was
14	collapsing
15	.

1	Although
2	the

8	a
9	substitute
10	offer
11	,
12	consisting
13	of
14	less

16	,
17	the

19	to
20	get
21	cash
22	from
23	Japanese
24	and
25	American
26	banks
27	confirmed
28	a
29	growing
30	fear
31	among
32	arbitragers
33	that
34	the
35	pageant
36	of
37	high-leverage
38	takeover

40	is
41	ending
42	.

1	Lots
2	of

14	a

44	.

1	As

3	,
4	few
5	favorable
6	reviews
7	were
8	heard
9	for
10	that
11	ever-present
12	marching

14	of

23	they
24	only
25	play
26	the

28	that
29	others
30	write
31	.

1	What
2	really
3	spooked
4	the
5	crowds
6	along
7	Wall
8	Street
9	,
10	however
11	,
12	was
13	the

7	by

21	indefinitely
22	its
23	planned
24	junk-bond
25	sale
26	and
27	restructuring
28	.

1	As
2	a
3	result
4	,
5	high-yield
6	mutual
7	funds
8	have
9	declined
10	across
11	the
12	board
13	and
14	the
15	many
16	firms
17	planning
18	to
19	sell
20	$
21	11
22	billion
23	in
24	junk
25	bonds
26	before
27	year-end
28	are
29	experiencing
30	anxious
31	times
32	.

1	These
2	are
3	all
4	market
5	excesses
6	(
7	putting
8	aside
9	the
10	artificial
11	boosts
12	that
13	the
14	tax
15	code
16	gives
17	to
18	debt
19	over
20	equity
21	)
22	,
23	and
24	what
25	we
26	've
27	seen
28	is
29	the
30	market
31	reining
32	them
33	in
34	.

1	Of
2	course
3	,
4	Washington
5	had
6	n't
7	been
8	silent
9	in
10	the
11	days
12	leading
13	up
14	to
15	the
16	debacle
17	,
18	and
19	its
20	tendency
21	to
22	meddle
23	in
24	the
25	leverage
26	equation
27	remains
28	a
29	troublesome
30	prospect
31	,
32	but
33	those
34	preliminary
35	steps
36	should
37	n't
38	distract
39	us
40	from
41	the
42	basic
43	market
44	fundamentalism
45	that
46	was
47	at
48	work
49	on
50	Friday
51	.

1	If
2	it
3	is
4	correct
5	to
6	find
7	that
8	concerns
9	over
10	corporate
11	debt
12	and
13	LBOs
14	caused
15	Gray
16	Friday
17	,
18	what
19	are
20	the
21	implications
22	for
23	policy
24	makers
25	?

1	After
2	all
3	,
4	the
5	stock
6	market
7	's
8	response
9	to
10	the
11	collapse
12	of
13	the
14	UAL
15	deal
16	might
17	be
18	taken
19	to
20	confirm
21	the
22	anti-debt
23	direction
24	of
25	regulators
26	.

1	Is
2	this
3	a
4	case
5	where
6	private
7	markets
8	are
9	approving
10	of
11	Washington
12	's
13	bashing
14	of
15	Wall
16	Street
17	?

1	Absolutely
2	not
3	.

1	To
2	the
3	extent
4	that
5	Friday
6	's
7	sell-off
8	reflected
9	a
10	sudden
11	reappraisal
12	of
13	the
14	excesses
15	of
16	leverage
17	,
18	the
19	message
20	is
21	that
22	Wall
23	Street
24	and
25	the
26	private
27	markets
28	are
29	fully
30	capable
31	of
32	imposing
33	the
34	appropriate
35	incentives
36	and
37	sanctions
38	on
39	corporate
40	behavior
41	.

1	The
2	national
3	economic
4	interests
5	are
6	much
7	better
8	served
9	allowing
10	the
11	private
12	interests
13	of
14	bankers
15	and
16	investors
17	be
18	the
19	ultimate
20	judges
21	of
22	the
23	investment
24	quality
25	of
26	various
27	LBO
28	deals
29	and
30	leveraged
31	restructurings
32	.

1	The
2	recent
3	difficulties
4	in
5	the
6	junk-bond
7	markets
8	and
9	the
10	scarcity
11	of
12	bank
13	capital
14	for
15	recent
16	deals
17	underscores
18	the
19	wisdom
20	of
21	letting
22	the
23	free
24	markets
25	operate
26	.

1	If
2	takeover
3	premiums
4	become
5	excessive
6	,
7	if
8	LBO
9	dealmakers
10	become
11	too
12	aggressive
13	,
14	then
15	the
16	private
17	market
18	will
19	recognize
20	these
21	problems
22	more
23	quickly
24	and
25	accurately
26	than
27	will
28	policy
29	makers
30	,
31	and
32	the
33	markets
34	will
35	move
36	with
37	lightning
38	speed
39	to
40	impose
41	appropriate
42	sanctions
43	.

1	Yes
2	,
3	the
4	broader
5	exchanges
6	got
7	caught
8	up
9	in
10	the
11	spiral
12	,
13	but
14	they
15	rode
16	the
17	tiger
18	up
19	all
20	year
21	.

1	Not
2	surprisingly
3	,
4	he
5	sometimes
6	bites
7	.

1	The
2	arbitragers
3	and
4	takeover
5	initiatiors
6	got
7	killed
8	on
9	Gray
10	Friday
11	,
12	while
13	the
14	besieged
15	managers
16	of
17	prospective
18	targets
19	cheered
20	lustily
21	.

1	If
2	you
3	identify
4	with
5	the
6	besieged
7	managers
8	,
9	you
10	must
11	concede
12	that
13	speedy
14	and
15	effective
16	relief
17	from
18	the
19	excesses
20	of
21	the
22	takeover
23	market
24	is
25	more
26	likely
27	to
28	come
29	from
30	the
31	marketplace
32	than
33	from
34	Washington
35	.

1	If
2	you
3	side
4	with
5	the
6	arbitragers
7	and
8	raiders
9	,
10	you
11	clearly
12	have
13	more
14	to
15	fear
16	from
17	private
18	investors
19	than
20	from
21	regulators
22	,
23	although
24	the
25	Delaware
26	courts
27	should
28	never
29	be
30	underestimated
31	.

1	The
2	truth
3	is
4	,
5	Washington
6	understands
7	politics
8	better
9	than
10	economics
11	.

1	Although
2	the
3	average
4	citizen
5	is
6	probably
7	not
8	harmed
9	too
10	much
11	from
12	Washington
13	's
14	rhetorical
15	war
16	against
17	Wall
18	Street
19	regarding
20	excessive
21	financial
22	leveraging
23	,
24	actual
25	legislation
26	would
27	probably
28	impose
29	considerable
30	harm
31	.

1	Any
2	such
3	attempt
4	to
5	distinguish
6	``
7	good
8	debt
9	''
10	from
11	``
12	bad
13	debt
14	,
15	''
16	or
17	to
18	draw
19	the
20	line
21	at
22	a
23	particular
24	industry
25	,
26	such
27	as
28	the
29	airlines
30	,
31	is
32	likely
33	to
34	blunt
35	the
36	spur
37	that
38	the
39	proper
40	amount
41	of
42	leverage
43	provides
44	both
45	to
46	equity
47	markets
48	and
49	economic
50	efficiency
51	in
52	general
53	.

1	Far
2	better
3	for
4	policy
5	makers
6	to
7	concentrate
8	on
9	the
10	war
11	against
12	drugs
13	,
14	Panama
15	and
16	the
17	deficit
18	,
19	all
20	of

1	The

53	to
54	sue
55	any
56	firm
57	or
58	agency
59	he
60	thinks
61	is
62	being
63	too
64	dirty
65	.

1	The
2	initiative
3	is
4	based
5	largely
6	on
7	the
8	wish-lists
9	of
10	the
11	green
12	lobby
13	:
14	the
15	Sierra
16	Club
17	,
18	the
19	League
20	of
21	Conservation
22	Voters
23	,
24	the
25	Natural
26	Resources
27	Defense
28	Council
29	,
30	the
31	National
32	Toxics
33	Campaign
34	and
35	the
36	Citizens
37	for
38	a
39	Better
40	Environment
41	.

1	Interestingly
2	,
3	the
4	Environmental
5	Defense
6	Fund
7	is
8	having
9	nothing
10	to
11	do
12	with
13	this
14	one
15	.

1	Not
2	only
3	Californians
4	but
5	all
6	Americans
7	would
8	pay
9	if
10	this
11	thing
12	passed
13	.

1	The
2	initiative
3	bars
4	the
5	sale
6	of
7	any
8	crops
9	in
10	California
11	that
12	do
13	n't
14	meet
15	the
16	initiative
17	's
18	standards
19	.

1	Kansas
2	wheat
3	farmers
4	and
5	Florida
6	fruit
7	growers
8	would
9	have
10	to
11	adjust
12	or
13	give
14	up
15	the
16	California
17	market
18	.

1	In
2	other
3	words
4	,
5	California
6	is
7	presuming
8	to
9	take
10	control
11	of
12	the
13	nation
14	's
15	farm
16	policy
17	.

1	As
2	usual
3	the
4	green
5	lobby
6	's
7	proposal
8	is
9	disconnected
10	from
11	scientific
12	reality
13	.

1	Consider
2	the
3	greenhouse-effect
4	provision
5	.

1	The
2	proposed
3	initiative
4	would
5	mandate
6	a
7	reduction
8	of
9	carbon
10	dioxide
11	of
12	40
13	%
14	.

1	Even
2	if
3	one
4	buys
5	into
6	the
7	whole
8	greenhouse
9	theory
10	,
11	it
12	is
13	inconceivable
14	that
15	reductions
16	in
17	a
18	single
19	state
20	could
21	have
22	any
23	impact
24	on
25	what
26	is
27	billed
28	as
29	a
30	global
31	problem
32	.

1	But
2	if
3	rational
4	science
5	and
6	economics
7	have
8	nothing
9	to
10	do
11	with
12	the
13	new
14	environment
15	initiative
16	,
17	what
18	is
19	going
20	on
21	?

1	The
2	first
3	place
4	to
5	look
6	under
7	these
8	circumstances
9	is
10	at
11	the
12	ways
13	in
14	which
15	the
16	sponsors
17	themselves
18	will
19	benefit
20	.

1	The
2	key
3	here
4	is
5	the
6	ambition
7	of
8	state
9	Attorney
10	General
11	John
12	Van
13	de
14	Kamp
15	.

1	He
2	's
3	running
4	for
5	governor
6	.

1	Mr.
2	Van
3	de
4	Kamp
5	is
6	the
7	one
8	who
9	collected
10	the
11	plans
12	from
13	the
14	various
15	radical
16	environmental
17	groups
18	and
19	cobbled
20	them
21	into
22	a
23	single
24	unwieldy
25	initiative
26	to
27	be
28	placed
29	on
30	the
31	ballot
32	for
33	election
34	on
35	Nov.
36	6
37	,
38	1990
39	.

1	That
2	's
3	also
4	the
5	day
6	of
7	the
8	gubernatorial
9	election
10	.

1	The
2	initiative
3	seems
4	to
5	have
6	been
7	crafted
8	to
9	include
10	all
11	the
12	hot
13	issues
14	that
15	set
16	off
17	the
18	wealthy
19	Hollywood
20	weepers
21	who
22	donate
23	money
24	.

1	And
2	it
3	allows
4	Mr.
5	Van
6	de
7	Kamp
8	to
9	get
10	around
11	campaign
12	spending
13	limits
14	.

1	He
2	can
3	spend
4	the
5	legal
6	maximum
7	for
8	his
9	campaign
10	;
11	all
12	the
13	spending
14	for
15	the
16	Van
17	de
18	Kamp
19	initiative
20	(
21	on
22	which
23	there
24	are
25	no
26	limits
27	)
28	is
29	gravy
30	.

1	This
2	initiative
3	is
4	being
5	labeled
6	The
7	Big
8	Green
9	,
10	but
11	maybe
12	it
13	should
14	be
15	called
16	The
17	Big
18	Greenback
19	.

1	(
2	The
3	Republican
4	candidate
5	,
6	Sen.
7	Pete
8	Wilson
9	,
10	is
11	playing
12	the
13	initiative
14	fundraising
15	game
16	too
17	,
18	sponsoring
19	his
20	own
21	crime
22	initiative
23	.
24	)

1	While
2	it
3	is
4	possible
5	that
6	the
7	Big
8	Green
9	initiative
10	will
11	be
12	ruled
13	unconstitutional
14	,
15	it
16	is
17	of
18	course
19	conceivable
20	that
21	in
22	modern
23	California
24	it
25	could
26	slide
27	through
28	.

1	This
2	is
3	the
4	state
5	that
6	recently
7	passed
8	the
9	Prop.
10	65
11	anti-toxic
12	initiative
13	.

1	If
2	this
3	new
4	proposal
5	ever
6	does
7	become
8	law
9	,
10	the
11	green
12	lobby
13	will
14	benefit
15	directly
16	.

1	The
2	initiative
3	creates
4	a
5	free
6	floating
7	state
8	environmental
9	officer
10	to
11	sue
12	companies
13	or
14	government
15	agencies
16	that
17	do
18	things
19	he
20	does
21	n't
22	like
23	.

1	That
2	means
3	the
4	NRDC
5	and
6	such
7	groups
8	no
9	longer
10	would
11	have
12	to
13	spend
14	as
15	much
16	money
17	on
18	litigation
19	;
20	taxpayers
21	would
22	bear
23	the
24	cost
25	.

1	Mr.
2	Van
3	de
4	Kamp
5	and
6	his
7	allies
8	may
9	be
10	hoping
11	that
12	the
13	environment
14	is
15	such
16	a
17	mom
18	and
19	apple-pie
20	issue
21	among
22	certain
23	segments
24	of
25	California
26	's
27	population
28	now
29	that
30	almost
31	any
32	collection
33	of
34	anti-scientific
35	,
36	anti-pocketbook
37	nonsense
38	can
39	pass
40	under
41	its
42	rubric
43	.

1	Of
2	course
3	the
4	state
5	's
6	liberals
7	are
8	not
9	yet
10	a
11	nation
12	unto
13	themselves
14	.

1	George
2	Bush
3	,
4	for
5	example
6	,
7	may
8	decide
9	that
10	he
11	does
12	n't
13	want
14	to
15	be
16	the
17	President
18	who
19	lost
20	control
21	of
22	interstate
23	commerce
24	to
25	an
26	attorney
27	general
28	from
29	California
30	.

1	And
2	some
3	other
4	segments
5	of
6	California
7	's
8	political
9	and
10	media
11	culture
12	may
13	yet
14	start
15	to
16	point
17	out
18	that
19	the
20	initiative
21	would
22	impose
23	significant
24	costs
25	on
26	the
27	state
28	's
29	less
30	affluent
31	citizens
32	in
33	the
34	form
35	of
36	higher
37	food
38	prices
39	and
40	lost
41	jobs
42	.

1	This
2	grandiose
3	initiative
4	will
5	help
6	California
7	define
8	itself
9	for
10	the
11	future
12	either
13	as
14	a
15	state
16	still
17	tethered
18	to
19	economic
20	and
21	scientific
22	reality
23	,
24	or
25	as
26	one
27	being
28	led
29	to
30	wherever
31	its
32	la-la
33	activists
34	want
35	to
36	take
37	it
38	.

15	looked
16	as
17	if
18	stocks
19	were
20	headed
21	for
22	yet
23	another
24	big
25	tumble
26	.

1	More
2	stocks
3	opened
4	over
5	the

17	in
18	charge
19	of
20	keeping
21	the
22	market
23	orderly
24	groped
25	to
26	find
27	buy
28	orders
29	from
30	major
31	brokerage
32	firms
33	to
34	match
35	the

37	flood
38	.

1	Then
2	,
3	to
4	make
5	matters
6	worse
7	,
8	computerized
9	sell
10	programs
11	kicked
12	in
13	,
14	hammering
15	stocks
16	into
17	steeper
18	losses
19	.

1	There
2	was
3	heavy
4	stock-index
5	arbitrage
6	,
7	as
8	traders
9	sold
10	big
11	baskets
12	of
13	stock
14	and
15	bought
16	stock-index
17	futures
18	to
19	profit
20	from
21	the
22	price
23	discrepancies
24	between
25	the
26	two
27	markets
28	.

1	This
2	was
3	a
4	hangover
5	from
6	Friday
7	,
8	when
9	Standard
10	&
11	Poor
12	's
13	500-stock
14	index

16	had
17	closed
18	at
19	a
20	sharp
21	discount
22	to
23	stocks
24	.

1	The
2	onslaught
3	of
4	the
5	program
6	selling
7	dashed
8	any
9	hopes
10	that
11	some
12	of
13	the
14	big
15	program
16	trading
17	firms
18	would
19	hold
20	off
21	until
22	the
23	market
24	stabilized
25	.

1	They
2	did
3	n't
4	.

1	The
2	Dow
3	accelerated
4	its
5	slide
6	,
7	losing
8	63.52
9	in
10	the
11	first
12	40
13	minutes
14	of
15	trading
16	.

1	With
2	program
3	traders
4	seemingly
5	in
6	charge
7	,
8	buyers
9	backed
10	away
11	from
12	the
13	market
14	and
15	watched
16	stocks
17	fall
18	.

1	Then
2	at
3	10:15
4	the
5	Dow
6	suddenly
7	started
8	to
9	rebound
10	,
11	and
12	when
13	it
14	shot
15	upward
16	it
17	did
18	so
19	even
20	faster
21	than
22	the
23	early-morning
24	fall
25	.

1	And
2	this
3	time
4	,
5	it
6	was
7	n't
8	just
9	the
10	program
11	traders

13	were
14	responsible
15	.

1	All
2	the

4	had
5	pushed
6	stocks
7	to

14	banks
15	and
16	major
17	money
18	management

4	matter
5	,
6	flights
7	from

19	under

1	The

1	The

22	repeatedly
23	since
24	reaching
25	a
26	high
27	early

30	.

1	Its
2	ragged
3	behavior
4	through
5	much
6	of
7	1989
8	has
9	prompted

19	Mr.

3	on
4	the
5	recent
6	strength
7	in
8	their
9	index
10	,
11	called
12	the
13	long
14	leading

17	the

19	analysts
20	foresee
21	uninterrupted
22	economic
23	growth
24	through
25	the

27	of
28	this
29	year
30	and
31	next
32	year
33	as
34	well
35	.

1	They
2	expect
3	a
4	2.6

7	in

9	in

11	gross
12	national

15	after
16	adjustment
17	for
18	inflation
19	.

1	Underlying
2	this
3	optimism
4	is
5	the
6	index
7	's
8	longstanding
9	ability
10	to
11	signal
12	recessions
13	or
14	recoveries
15	,
16	as

1	The

5	have
6	reconstructed

10	charged

1	Mr.

1	Mr.

1	The

7	of
8	arranging
9	peace
10	settlements
11	and
12	then
13	washing
14	its

1	It

1	State
2	and
3	the

11	and
12	his
13	fellow
14	defendants
15	be
16	released
17	and
18	that
19	the
20	United
21	Nation
22	's
23	monitors
24	make
25	certain
26	that

30	investigates
31	election
32	complaints
33	from
34	all

1	Yesterday
2	's
3	October
4	gain
5	of
6	$
7	4
8	was
9	miniscule
10	compared
11	with
12	that
13	.

1	One
2	analyst
3	,
4	Peter
5	Cardillo
6	of
7	Josephthal
8	&
9	Co.
10	,
11	New
12	York
13	,
14	said
15	the
16	gold
17	market
18	already
19	had
20	some
21	good
22	price-supporting
23	technical
24	factors
25	that
26	would
27	have
28	caused
29	prices
30	to
31	rise
32	,
33	with
34	or
35	without
36	the
37	stock
38	market
39	.

1	``
2	What
3	the
4	stock
5	market
6	did
7	was
8	cause
9	the
10	rise
11	to
12	take
13	place
14	earlier
15	than
16	it
17	would
18	have
19	happened
20	,
21	''
22	said
23	Mr.
24	Cardillo
25	.

1	There
2	's
3	a
4	good
5	chance
6	that
7	gold
8	will
9	retain
10	its
11	gains
12	and
13	rise
14	further
15	,
16	he
17	said
18	.

1	He
2	expects
3	a
4	drop
5	in
6	interest
7	rates
8	,
9	which
10	would
11	help
12	gold
13	by
14	keeping
15	the
16	dollar
17	from
18	rising
19	.

1	Finally
2	,
3	according
4	to
5	Mr.
6	Cardillo
7	,
8	the
9	impact
10	of
11	the
12	strong
13	dollar
14	should
15	be
16	reflected
17	in
18	reduced
19	exports
20	in
21	the
22	August
23	merchandise
24	trade
25	deficit
26	,
27	when
28	the
29	figures
30	are
31	released
32	today
33	.

1	This
2	would
3	be
4	damaging
5	to
6	the
7	dollar
8	and
9	supportive
10	for
11	gold
12	,
13	he
14	said
15	.

1	ENERGY
2	:

1	Worried
2	that
3	Friday
4	's
5	190-point
6	stock
7	market
8	plunge
9	might
10	be
11	a
12	harbinger
13	of
14	things
15	to
16	come
17	for
18	the
19	economy
20	,
21	petroleum
22	futures
23	traders
24	called
25	a
26	halt
27	to
28	the
29	recent
30	string
31	of
32	increases
33	in
34	crude
35	oil
36	futures
37	prices
38	.

1	The
2	U.S.
3	benchmark
4	crude
5	,
6	West
7	Texas
8	Intermediate
9	,
10	closed
11	at
12	$
13	20.59
14	a
15	barrel
16	for
17	November
18	delivery
19	,
20	down
21	30
22	cents
23	.

1	Some
2	analysts
3	said
4	crude
5	was
6	due
7	for
8	a
9	correction
10	anyhow
11	,
12	following
13	several
14	days
15	of
16	significant
17	gains
18	.

1	But
2	most
3	market
4	observers
5	agreed
6	that
7	Friday
8	's
9	stock
10	market
11	drop
12	is
13	what
14	dampened
15	spirits
16	in
17	the
18	petroleum
19	pits
20	yesterday
21	.

1	Until
2	yesterday
3	,
4	futures
5	prices
6	had
7	been
8	headed
9	up
10	on
11	expectations
12	that
13	world
14	oil
15	demand
16	will
17	continue
18	to
19	be
20	strong
21	.

1	The
2	Organization
3	of
4	Petroleum
5	Exporting
6	Countries
7	increased
8	its
9	production
10	ceiling
11	for
12	the
13	fourth
14	quarter
15	based
16	on
17	projections
18	of
19	robust
20	demand
21	.

1	So
2	any
3	bearish
4	indicator
5	,
6	such
7	as
8	Friday
9	's
10	precipitous
11	drop
12	in
13	the
14	stock
15	market
16	,
17	sends
18	shivers
19	through
20	the
21	oil
22	markets
23	as
24	well
25	.

1	Indeed
2	,
3	after
4	reacting
5	early
6	in
7	the
8	trading
9	day
10	to
11	Friday
12	's
13	plummet
14	,
15	futures
16	prices
17	firmed
18	up
19	again
20	as
21	traders
22	took
23	note
24	of
25	the
26	stock
27	market
28	's
29	partial
30	recovery
31	yesterday
32	.

1	COPPER
2	:

1	Futures
2	prices
3	fell
4	and
5	showed
6	little
7	rebound
8	as
9	one
10	major
11	labor
12	problem
13	that
14	had
15	been
16	underpinning
17	prices
18	appeared
19	to
20	be
21	solved
22	.

1	The
2	December
3	contract
4	declined
5	3.05
6	cents
7	a
8	pound
9	to
10	$
11	1.2745
12	.

1	Prices
2	were
3	down
4	from
5	the
6	outset
7	of
8	trading
9	on
10	concern
11	that
12	a
13	drop
14	in
15	the
16	stock
17	market
18	might
19	create
20	a
21	weakened
22	economy
23	and
24	a
25	consequent
26	reduction
27	in
28	copper
29	use
30	.

1	But
2	the
3	recovery
4	in
5	the
6	stock
7	market
8	provided
9	little
10	help
11	for
12	copper
13	as
14	word
15	spread
16	that
17	a
18	three-month
19	strike
20	at
21	the
22	Highland
23	Valley
24	mine
25	in
26	British
27	Columbia
28	was
29	about
30	over
31	,
32	according
33	to
34	an
35	analyst
36	.

1	Highland
2	Valley
3	is
4	a
5	large
6	Canadian
7	producer
8	and
9	principal
10	supplier
11	to
12	Japan
13	,
14	which
15	recently
16	began
17	seeking
18	copper
19	elsewhere
20	as
21	its
22	inventories
23	shrank
24	.

1	Last
2	week
3	it
4	was
5	reported
6	that
7	company
8	and
9	union
10	negotiations
11	had
12	overcome
13	the
14	major
15	hurdle
16	,
17	the
18	contracting
19	out
20	of
21	work
22	by
23	the
24	company
25	.

1	Now
2	,
3	the
4	analyst
5	said
6	,
7	only
8	minor
9	points
10	remain
11	to
12	be
13	cleaned
14	up
15	.

1	``
2	For
3	all

8	an

10	appears

12	have

17	he

11	the

1	However

11	and
12	selling
13	by
14	funds
15	that

1	But

2	other
3	factors
4	played
5	a
6	part
7	in
8	yesterday
9	's
10	comeback
11	.

1	The

11	the

16	began

14	bounced
15	back
16	strongly
17	to

22	fears
23	that
24	foreigners
25	would
26	unload
27	U.S.
28	stocks
29	.

1	And
2	the
3	widely
4	disseminated
5	opinion
6	among

9	experts
10	that
11	a

13	was
14	n't
15	in

17	also
18	helped
19	calm

21	.

1	Many

4	,
5	for

7	,
8	came
9	into

11	yesterday
12	ready

20	often
21	passed
22	around
23	the

1	So
2	investors
3	everywhere
4	nervously
5	eyed
6	yesterday
7	's
8	opening
9	in
10	Tokyo
11	,

13	the

20	got
21	off

12	in
13	the
14	first
15	20
16	minutes
17	of

19	.

1	But
2	the
3	selling
4	wave
5	had
6	no
7	conviction
8	,
9	and
10	the
11	market
12	first
13	surged
14	upward

1	That

15	then
16	bet
17	that

20	peaked

1	A
2	quick
3	turnaround
4	is
5	crucial
6	to
7	Quantum
8	because
9	its
10	cash
11	requirements
12	remain
13	heavy
14	.

1	The

6	its
7	annual
8	payments
9	on

13	more

15	double

19	ago
20	to
21	about
22	$
23	240

25	,
26	largely

30	taken
31	on
32	to

34	a
35	$
36	50-a-share
37	special
38	dividend
39	earlier
40	this
41	year
42	.

1	Quantum
2	described
3	the
4	payout
5	at
6	the
7	time
8	as
9	a
10	way
11	for
12	it
13	to
14	share
15	the
16	bonanza
17	with
18	its
19	holders
20	,
21	because
22	its
23	stock
24	price
25	was
26	n't
27	reflecting
28	the
29	huge
30	profit
31	increases
32	.

1	Some
2	analysts
3	saw
4	the

6	as
7	an
8	effort
9	also
10	to
11	dispel

1	Whether
2	a

8	confronts

10	disaster
11	at
12	its
13	plant
14	in
15	Morris
16	,
17	Ill
18	.

1	After
2	an
3	explosion
4	idled
5	the
6	plant
7	in
8	June
9	,
10	the
11	company
12	progressed
13	in
14	September
15	to
16	within
17	12
18	hours
19	of
20	completing
21	the
22	drawn-out
23	process
24	of
25	restarting
26	it
27	.

1	Then
2	a
3	second
4	explosion
5	occurred
6	.

1	Two
2	workers
3	died
4	and
5	six
6	remain
7	in
8	the
9	hospital
10	.

1	This
2	human
3	toll
4	adds
5	the
6	most
7	painful
8	dimension
9	yet
10	to
11	the
12	sudden
13	change
14	in
15	Quantum
16	's
17	fortunes
18	.

1	Until
2	this
3	year
4	,
5	the
6	company
7	had
8	been
9	steadily
10	lowering
11	its
12	accident
13	rate
14	and
15	picking
16	up
17	trade-group
18	safety
19	awards
20	.

1	A
2	prolonged
3	production
4	halt
5	at
6	the
7	plant
8	could
9	introduce
10	another
11	imponderable
12	into
13	Quantum
14	's
15	financial
16	future
17	.

1	When
2	a
3	plant
4	has
5	just
6	been
7	running
8	flat
9	out
10	to
11	meet
12	demand
13	,
14	calculating
15	lost
16	profit
17	and
18	thus
19	claims
20	under
21	business-interruption
22	insurance
23	is
24	straightforward
25	.

1	But
2	the
3	numbers
4	become
5	trickier
6	--
7	and
8	subject
9	to
10	dickering
11	between
12	insured
13	and
14	insurer
15	--
16	when
17	demand
18	is
19	shifting
20	.

1	Not
2	everything
3	looks
4	grim
5	for
6	Quantum
7	.

1	The
2	plant
3	expansion

16	market
17	share
18	is
19	often
20	taken
21	through
22	sheer
23	capacity
24	.

1	By
2	lifting
3	ethylene
4	production
5	,
6	the
7	expansion
8	will
9	also
10	lower
11	the

3	Quantum
4	has
5	a

7	to

26	in
27	that

29	by
30	early
31	November
32	.

1	A
2	P&G
3	spokeswoman
4	confirmed
5	that
6	shipments
7	to
8	Phoenix
9	started
10	late
11	last
12	month
13	.

1	She
2	said
3	the
4	company
5	will
6	study
7	results
8	from
9	this
10	market
11	before
12	expanding
13	to
14	others
15	.

1	Superconcentrates
2	are
3	n't
4	entirely
5	new
6	for
7	P&G
8	.

1	The
2	company
3	introduced
4	a
5	superconcentrated
6	Lemon
7	Cheer
8	in
9	Japan
10	after
11	watching
12	the
13	success
14	of
15	Attack
16	.

1	When
2	Attack
3	hit
4	the
5	shelves
6	in
7	1987
8	,
9	P&G
10	's
11	share
12	of
13	the
14	Japanese
15	market
16	fell
17	to
18	about
19	8
20	%
21	from
22	more
23	than
24	20
25	%
26	.

1	With
2	the
3	help
4	of
5	Lemon
6	Cheer
7	,
8	P&G
9	's
10	share
11	is
12	now
13	estimated
14	to
15	be
16	12
17	%
18	.

1	While
2	the
3	Japanese
4	have
5	embraced
6	the
7	compact
8	packaging
9	and
10	convenience
11	of
12	concentrated
13	products
14	,
15	the
16	true
17	test
18	for
19	P&G
20	will
21	be
22	in
23	the
24	$
25	4
26	billion
27	U.S.
28	detergent
29	market
30	,
31	where
32	growth
33	is
34	slow
35	and
36	liquids
37	have
38	gained
39	prominence
40	over
41	powders
42	.

1	The
2	company
3	may
4	have
5	chosen
6	to
7	market
8	the
9	product
10	under
11	the
12	Cheer
13	name
14	since
15	it
16	's
17	already
18	expanded
19	its
20	best-selling
21	Tide
22	into
23	16
24	different
25	varieties
26	,
27	including
28	this
29	year
30	's
31	big
32	hit
33	,
34	Tide
35	with
36	Bleach
37	.

1	With
2	superconcentrates
3	,
4	however
5	,
6	it
7	is
8	n't
9	always
10	easy
11	to
12	persuade
13	consumers
14	that
15	less
16	is
17	more
18	;
19	many
20	people
21	tend
22	to
23	dump
24	too
25	much
26	detergent
27	into
28	the
29	washing
30	machine
31	,
32	believing
33	that
34	it
35	takes
36	a
37	cup
38	of
39	powder
40	to
41	really
42	clean
43	the
44	laundry
45	.

1	In
2	the
3	early
4	1980s
5	,
6	P&G
7	tried
8	to
9	launch
10	here
11	a
12	concentrated
13	detergent
14	under
15	the
16	Ariel
17	brand
18	name
19	that
20	it
21	markets
22	in
23	Europe
24	.

1	But
2	the
3	product
4	,
5	which
6	was
7	n't
8	as
9	concentrated
10	as
11	the
12	new
13	Cheer
14	,
15	bombed
16	in
17	a
18	market
19	test
20	in
21	Denver
22	and
23	was
24	dropped
25	.

1	P&G
2	and
3	others
4	also
5	have
6	tried
7	repeatedly
8	to
9	hook
10	consumers
11	on
12	detergent
13	and
14	fabric
15	softener
16	combinations
17	in
18	pouches
19	,
20	but
21	they
22	have
23	n't
24	sold
25	well
26	,
27	despite
28	the
29	convenience
30	.

1	But
2	P&G
3	contends
4	the
5	new
6	Cheer
7	is
8	a
9	unique
10	formula
11	that
12	also
13	offers
14	an
15	ingredient
16	that
17	prevents
18	colors
19	from
20	fading
21	.

1	And
2	retailers
3	are
4	expected
5	to
6	embrace
7	the
8	product
9	,
10	in
11	part
12	because
13	it
14	will
15	take
16	up
17	less
18	shelf
19	space
20	.

1	``
2	When
3	shelf
4	space
5	was
6	cheap
7	,
8	bigger
9	was
10	better
11	,
12	''
13	says
14	Hugh
15	Zurkuhlen
16	,
17	an
18	analyst
19	at
20	Salomon
21	Bros
22	.

1	But
2	with
3	so
4	many
5	brands
6	vying
7	for
8	space
9	,
10	that
11	's
12	no
13	longer
14	the
15	case
16	.

1	If
2	the
3	new
4	Cheer
5	sells
6	well
7	,
8	the
9	trend
10	toward
11	smaller
12	packaging
13	is
14	likely
15	to
16	accelerate
17	as
18	competitors
19	follow
20	with
21	their
22	own
23	superconcentrates
24	.

1	Then
2	retailers
3	``
4	will
5	probably
6	push
7	the
8	{
9	less-established
10	}
11	brands
12	out
13	altogether
14	,
15	''
16	he
17	says
18	.

1	Competition
2	is
3	bound
4	to
5	get
6	tougher
7	if
8	Kao
9	introduces
10	a
11	product
12	like
13	Attack
14	in
15	the
16	U.S.
17	.

1	To
2	be
3	sure
4	,
5	Kao
6	would
7	n't
8	have
9	an
10	easy
11	time
12	taking
13	U.S.
14	market
15	share
16	away
17	from
18	the
19	mighty
20	P&G
21	,
22	which
23	has
24	about
25	23
26	%
27	of
28	the
29	market
30	.

1	Kao
2	officials
3	previously
4	have
5	said
6	they
7	are
8	interested
9	in
10	selling
11	detergents
12	in
13	the
14	U.S.
15	,
16	but
17	so
18	far
19	the
20	company
21	has
22	focused
23	on
24	acquisitions
25	,
26	such
27	as
28	last
29	year
30	's
31	purchase
32	of
33	Andrew
34	Jergens
35	Co.
36	,
37	a
38	Cincinnati
39	hand-lotion
40	maker
41	.

1	It
2	also
3	has
4	a
5	product-testing
6	facility
7	in
8	California
9	.

1	Some
2	believe
3	P&G
4	's
5	interest
6	in
7	a
8	superconcentrated
9	detergent
10	goes
11	beyond
12	the
13	concern
14	for
15	the
16	Japanese
17	.

1	``
2	This
3	is
4	something
5	P&G
6	would
7	do
8	with
9	or
10	without
11	Kao
12	,
13	''
14	says
15	Mr.
16	Zurkuhlen
17	.

1	With
2	economic
3	tension
4	between
5	the
6	U.S.
7	and
8	Japan
9	worsening
10	,
11	many
12	Japanese
13	had
14	feared
15	last
16	week
17	's
18	visit
19	from
20	U.S.
21	Trade
22	Representative
23	Carla
24	Hills
25	.

1	They
2	expected
3	a
4	new
5	barrage
6	of
7	demands
8	that
9	Japan
10	do
11	something
12	quickly
13	to
14	reduce
15	its
16	trade
17	surplus
18	with
19	the
20	U.S.
21	.

1	Instead
2	,
3	they
4	got
5	a
6	discussion
7	of
8	the
9	need
10	for
11	the
12	U.S.
13	and
14	Japan
15	to
16	work
17	together
18	and
19	of
20	the
21	importance
22	of
23	the
24	long-term
25	view
26	.

1	Mrs.
2	Hills
3	'
4	first
5	trip
6	to
7	Japan
8	as
9	America
10	's
11	chief
12	trade
13	negotiator
14	had
15	a
16	completely
17	different
18	tone
19	from
20	last
21	month
22	's
23	visit
24	by
25	Commerce
26	Secretary
27	Robert
28	A.
29	Mosbacher
30	.

1	Mr.
2	Mosbacher
3	called
4	for
5	concrete
6	results
7	by
8	next
9	spring
10	in
11	negotiations
12	over
13	fundamental
14	Japanese
15	business
16	practices
17	that
18	supposedly
19	inhibit
20	free
21	trade
22	.

1	He
2	said
3	such
4	results
5	should
6	be
7	``
8	measurable
9	in
10	dollars
11	and
12	cents
13	''
14	in
15	reducing
16	the
17	U.S.
18	trade
19	deficit
20	with
21	Japan
22	.

1	But
2	Mrs.
3	Hills
4	,
5	speaking
6	at
7	a
8	breakfast
9	meeting
10	of
11	the
12	American
13	Chamber
14	of
15	Commerce
16	in
17	Japan
18	on
19	Saturday
20	,
21	stressed
22	that
23	the
24	objective
25	``
26	is
27	not
28	to
29	get
30	definitive
31	action
32	by
33	spring
34	or
35	summer
36	,
37	it
38	is
39	rather
40	to
41	have
42	a
43	blueprint
44	for
45	action
46	.
47	''

1	She
2	added
3	that
4	she
5	expected
6	``
7	perhaps
8	to
9	have
10	a
11	down
12	payment

14	some
15	small
16	step
17	to
18	convince
19	the
20	American
21	people
22	and
23	the
24	Japanese
25	people
26	that
27	we
28	're
29	moving
30	in
31	earnest
32	.
33	''

1	How
2	such
3	remarks
4	translate
5	into
6	policy
7	wo
8	n't
9	become
10	clear
11	for
12	months
13	.

1	American
2	and
3	Japanese
4	officials
5	offered
6	several
7	theories
8	for
9	the
10	difference
11	in
12	approach
13	betwen
14	Mr.
15	Mosbacher
16	and
17	Mrs.
18	Hills
19	.

1	Many
2	called
3	it
4	simply
5	a
6	contrast
7	in
8	styles
9	.

1	But
2	some
3	saw
4	it
5	as
6	a
7	classic
8	negotiating
9	tactic
10	.

1	Others
2	said
3	the
4	Bush
5	administration
6	may
7	feel
8	the
9	rhetoric
10	on
11	both
12	sides
13	is
14	getting
15	out
16	of
17	hand
18	.

1	And
2	some
3	said
4	it
5	reflected
6	the
7	growing
8	debate
9	in
10	Washington
11	over
12	pursuing
13	free
14	trade
15	with
16	Japan
17	versus
18	some
19	kind
20	of
21	managed
22	trade
23	.

1	Asked
2	to
3	compare
4	her
5	visit
6	to
7	Mr.
8	Mosbacher
9	's
10	,
11	Mrs.
12	Hills
13	replied
14	:
15	``
16	I
17	did
18	n't
19	hear

25	but
26	as
27	a
28	general

31	I

19	Saturday
20	afternoon

1	When
2	she
3	met
4	the
5	local
6	press
7	for
8	the
9	first
10	time
11	on
12	Friday
13	,
14	Mrs.
15	Hills
16	firmly
17	reiterated
18	the
19	need
20	for
21	progress
22	in
23	removing
24	barriers
25	to
26	trade
27	in
28	forest
29	products
30	,
31	satellites
32	and
33	supercomputers
34	,
35	three
36	areas
37	targeted
38	under
39	the
40	Super
41	301
42	provision
43	of
44	the
45	1988
46	trade

48	.

1	She
2	highlighted
3	exclusionary
4	business
5	practices
6	that
7	the
8	U.S.
9	government
10	has
11	identified
12	.

1	But
2	her
3	main
4	thrust
5	was
6	to
7	promote
8	the
9	importance
10	of
11	world-wide
12	free
13	trade
14	and
15	open
16	competition
17	.

1	She
2	said
3	the
4	trade
5	imbalance
6	was
7	mainly
8	due
9	to
10	macroeconomic
11	factors

7	could
8	persist
9	through

1	Major

21	the
22	third
23	quarter
24	a

29	reflecting
30	deteriorating
31	chemical

36	.

1	The
2	gasoline
3	picture
4	may

9	but
10	chemicals
11	are

32	.

1	``
2	That

20	added
21	.

1	He
2	did
3	n't
4	forecast
5	Phillips
6	's
7	results
8	.

1	But
2	securities
3	analysts
4	say
5	Phillips
6	will
7	be
8	among
9	the
10	companies
11	hard-hit
12	by
13	weak
14	chemical
15	prices

17	will
18	probably
19	post
20	a
21	drop
22	in

25	.

1	So
2	,
3	too
4	,
5	many
6	analysts
7	predict
8	,
9	will
10	Exxon
11	Corp.
12	,
13	Chevron
14	Corp.
15	and
16	Amoco
17	Corp
18	.

1	Typical
2	is
3	what
4	happened
5	to
6	the
7	price
8	of

10	,
11	a
12	major

15	produced
16	in

18	amounts
19	by
20	many

1	It
2	has
3	plunged
4	13
5	%
6	since
7	July
8	to
9	around
10	26
11	cents

1	A

9	,
10	peaking
11	at
12	about
13	34
14	cents
15	last
16	December
17	.

1	A
2	big
3	reason
4	for
5	the
6	chemical
7	price
8	retreat
9	is
10	overexpansion
11	.

1	Beginning
2	in
3	mid-1987
4	,
5	prices
6	began
7	accelerating
8	as
9	a
10	growing
11	U.S.
12	economy
13	and
14	the
15	weak
16	dollar
17	spurred
18	demand
19	.

1	Companies
2	added
3	capacity
4	furiously
5	.

1	Now
2	,
3	greatly
4	increased
5	supplies
6	are
7	on
8	the
9	market
10	,
11	while
12	the
13	dollar
14	is
15	stronger
16	,
17	and
18	domestic
19	economic
20	growth

17	and
18	August
19	that
20	did
21	n't
22	materialize
23	.

1	The
2	excess
3	supply
4	pushed
5	gasoline
6	prices
7	down
8	in
9	that
10	period
11	.

1	In

3	,

10	from

4	picked
5	up
6	in
7	September
8	,
9	and
10	many
11	industry
12	officials
13	believe

17	rebound
18	this

27	of

32	.

1	During

1	Last

3	,
4	Mr.

6	moved
7	the
8	administration
9	in
10	the
11	direction
12	of
13	gradual
14	liberalization
15	when
16	he
17	told

2	more
3	recently
4	,
5	the
6	Pentagon
7	and
8	the
9	Commerce
10	Department
11	openly
12	feuded

1	However
2	,
3	these

1	But
2	HOFI

8	given
9	Ideal
10	's
11	other
12	shareholders
13	about
14	10
15	%
16	of

1	Ideal
2	's

1	The

3	is
4	subject
5	to
6	a
7	definitive
8	agreement
9	and
10	approval
11	by

1	While

9	below
10	their
11	drought-induced
12	peaks
13	of
14	1988
15	,
16	wheat
17	prices
18	remain
19	stubbornly
20	high
21	.

1	And
2	they
3	're
4	likely
5	to

7	that
8	way
9	for
10	months
11	to
12	come
13	,
14	analysts
15	say
16	.

1	For
2	one
3	thing
4	,
5	even
6	with
7	many
8	farmers
9	planting
10	more
11	winter
12	wheat
13	this
14	year
15	than
16	last
17	,
18	tight
19	wheat
20	supplies
21	are
22	likely
23	to
24	support
25	prices
26	well
27	into
28	1990
29	,
30	the
31	analysts
32	say
33	.

1	And
2	if

15	wheat-growing

17	,
18	yields
19	in
20	the
21	crop
22	now
23	being
24	planted
25	could
26	be
27	reduced
28	,
29	further
30	squeezing
31	supplies
32	.

1	Also
2	supporting
3	prices
4	are
5	expectations
6	that
7	the

11	place
12	substantial

1	That

4	the
5	lowest

8	Agriculture
9	Secretary

11	Yeutter
12	last

14	said
15	the

18	would
19	slightly
20	increase
21	the

23	of

25	farmers
26	can
27	plant
28	in
29	wheat
30	for

32	year
33	and
34	still
35	qualify
36	for

1	The

10	production
11	next
12	year
13	by
14	about
15	66
16	million
17	bushels
18	.

1	It
2	now
3	estimates
4	production
5	for
6	next
7	year
8	at
9	just
10	under
11	2.6
12	billion
13	bushels

28	in

30	.

1	But
2	the

10	wheat
11	now
12	being

25	.

1	Until

3	,
4	limited

11	near

13	$
14	4-a-bushel
15	level
16	,

1	In
2	theory
3	at

5	,
6	tight

1	Such

13	to
14	find
15	enough
16	soybeans

1	Mr.

3	said
4	he
5	would
6	n't
7	launch
8	a
9	hostile
10	bid
11	.

1	The
2	executive
3	close
4	to
5	Saatchi
6	&
7	Saatchi
8	said
9	that
10	``
11	if
12	a
13	bidder
14	came
15	up
16	with
17	a
18	ludicrously

20	offer
21	,
22	a
23	crazy
24	offer
25	which
26	Saatchi
27	knew
28	it
29	could
30	n't
31	beat
32	,
33	it
34	would
35	have
36	no
37	choice
38	but
39	to
40	recommend
41	it
42	to
43	shareholders

11	with

16	.

1	The
2	executive
3	said
4	any
5	buy-out
6	would
7	be
8	led
9	by
10	the
11	current
12	board
13	,
14	whose
15	chairman
16	is
17	Maurice
18	Saatchi

22	guiding
23	force
24	is
25	believed

28	Charles
29	Saatchi

1	The

3	did
4	n't
5	name
6	any
7	price
8	,
9	but
10	securities
11	analysts
12	have
13	said
14	Saatchi
15	would
16	fetch
17	upward
18	of
19	$
20	1.3
21	billion
22	.

1	The
2	executive
3	denied

7	was
8	bringing
9	in
10	the
11	new
12	chief
13	executive
14	officer
15	only
16	to
17	clean
18	up
19	the

22	so
23	that

1	That

1	Just

1	Now

10	34th
11	year
12	on
13	the
14	Supreme

16	today
17	,
18	the
19	occasion
20	will
21	differ
22	sharply
23	from
24	previous
25	anniversaries
26	of
27	his
28	tenure
29	.

1	For
2	the
3	first
4	time
5	,
6	the
7	83-year-old
8	justice
9	finds
10	his
11	influence
12	almost
13	exclusively
14	in
15	dissent
16	,
17	rather
18	than
19	as
20	a
21	force
22	in
23	the
24	high
25	court
26	's
27	majority
28	.

1	This
2	role
3	reversal
4	holds
5	true
6	,
7	as
8	well
9	,
10	for
11	his
12	three
13	liberal
14	and
15	moderate
16	allies
17	,
18	Justices
19	Thurgood
20	Marshall
21	,
22	Harry
23	Blackmun
24	and
25	John
26	Stevens
27	.

1	But
2	are
3	these
4	four
5	players
6	,
7	three
8	of
9	them
10	in
11	their
12	80s
13	,
14	ready
15	to
16	assume
17	a
18	different
19	role
20	after
21	88
22	years
23	,
24	collectively
25	,
26	of
27	service
28	on
29	the
30	high
31	court
32	?

1	Every
2	indication
3	is
4	that
5	the
6	four
7	are
8	prepared
9	to
10	accept
11	this
12	new
13	role
14	,
15	and
16	the
17	frustrations
18	that
19	go
20	with
21	it
22	,
23	but
24	in
25	different
26	ways
27	.

1	Justices
2	Brennan
3	and
4	Stevens
5	appear
6	philosophical
7	about
8	it
9	;
10	Justices
11	Marshall
12	and
13	Blackmun
14	appear
15	fighting
16	mad
17	.

1	The
2	four
3	justices
4	are
5	no
6	newcomers
7	to
8	dissent
9	,
10	often
11	joining
12	forces
13	in
14	the
15	past
16	decade
17	to
18	criticize
19	the
20	court
21	's
22	conservative
23	drift
24	.

1	But
2	always
3	,
4	in
5	years
6	past
7	,
8	they
9	have
10	bucked
11	the
12	trend
13	and
14	have
15	been
16	able
17	to
18	pick
19	up
20	a
21	fifth
22	vote
23	to
24	eke
25	out
26	a
27	number
28	of
29	major
30	victories
31	in
32	civil
33	rights
34	and
35	liberties
36	cases
37	.

1	Now
2	,
3	however
4	,
5	as
6	the
7	court
8	's
9	new
10	five-member
11	conservative
12	majority
13	continues
14	to
15	solidify
16	,
17	victories
18	for
19	the
20	liberals
21	are
22	rare
23	.

1	The
2	change
3	is
4	most
5	dramatic
6	for
7	Justice
8	Brennan
9	,
10	the
11	last
12	survivor
13	of
14	the
15	mid-1960s
16	liberal
17	majority
18	under
19	Chief
20	Justice
21	Earl
22	Warren
23	.

33	votes
34	in
35	555

37	decided
38	by
39	the

41	.

1	Last

4	he
5	cast
6	52
7	dissenting
8	votes
9	in

11	decisions
12	,
13	with
14	the

16	flag-burning
17	ruling
18	as
19	his
20	only
21	big
22	victory
23	.

1	But
2	Justice
3	Brennan
4	foresaw
5	his
6	new
7	role
8	,
9	strongly
10	defending
11	the
12	importance
13	of
14	dissents
15	in
16	a
17	1985
18	speech
19	.

19	reconsider
20	the

22	questions
23	and
24	to
25	rethink
26	the
27	result
28	,
29	''
30	he
31	said
32	.

1	Moreover
2	,
3	in
4	recent
5	months
6	he
7	has
8	said
9	that
10	when
11	he
12	was
13	on
14	the
15	winning
16	side
17	in
18	the
19	1960s
20	,
21	he

23	that
24	the
25	tables
26	might
27	turn
28	in
29	the
30	future
31	.

1	He
2	has
3	said
4	that
5	he
6	now
7	knows
8	how
9	Justice
10	John
11	Harlan
12	felt
13	,
14	a
15	reference
16	to
17	the
18	late
19	conservative
20	justice
21	who
22	was
23	the
24	most
25	frequent
26	dissenter
27	from
28	the
29	Warren
30	Court
31	's
32	opinions
33	.

1	Associates
2	of
3	81-year-old
4	Justice
5	Marshall
6	say
7	he
8	was
9	``
10	depressed
11	''
12	about
13	the
14	court
15	's
16	direction
17	last
18	spring
19	,
20	but
21	is
22	feisty
23	about
24	his
25	role
26	and
27	determined
28	to
29	speak
30	out
31	against
32	the
33	court
34	's
35	cutbacks
36	in
37	civil
38	rights

22	''
23	he
24	said
25	in
26	a
27	speech
28	last
29	month
30	.

1	He
2	,
3	like
4	Justice
5	Brennan
6	,
7	considers
8	dissents
9	highly
10	important
11	for
12	the
13	future
14	,
15	a
16	point
17	that
18	has
19	n't
20	escaped
21	legal
22	scholars
23	.

1	Harvard
2	Law
3	School
4	Professor
5	Laurence
6	Tribe
7	says
8	there
9	is
10	a
11	``
12	generation-skipping
13	''
14	flavor
15	to
16	current
17	dissents
18	.

1	The
2	dissenters
3	in
4	the
5	Warren
6	Court
7	,
8	he
9	says
10	,
11	appeared
12	to
13	be
14	writing
15	for
16	the
17	short-term
18	,
19	suggesting
20	that
21	the
22	court
23	's
24	direction
25	might
26	change
27	soon
28	.

1	``

17	he

3	,
4	who
5	will
6	turn
7	81
8	next
9	month
10	,
11	also
12	seems
13	feisty
14	about
15	his
16	new
17	role
18	.

1	Associates
2	say
3	he
4	takes
5	some
6	defeats
7	more
8	personally
9	than
10	his
11	colleagues
12	,
13	especially
14	attempts
15	to
16	curtail
17	the
18	right
19	to
20	abortion
21	first
22	recognized
23	in
24	his
25	1973
26	opinion
27	,
28	Roe
29	vs.
30	Wade
31	.

1	Friends
2	and
3	associates
4	who
5	saw
6	Justice
7	Blackmun
8	during
9	the
10	summer
11	said
12	he
13	was
14	no
15	more
16	discouraged
17	about
18	the
19	court
20	than
21	in
22	recent
23	years
24	.

1	And
2	his
3	outlook
4	improved
5	after
6	successful
7	cataract
8	surgery
9	in
10	August
11	.

1	But
2	his
3	level
4	of
5	frustration
6	showed
7	in
8	a
9	recent
10	,
11	impassioned
12	speech
13	to
14	a
15	group
16	of
17	hundreds
18	of
19	lawyers
20	in
21	Chicago
22	.

1	He
2	concluded
3	his
4	remarks
5	by
6	quoting
7	,
8	emotionally
9	and
10	at
11	some
12	length
13	,
14	according
15	to
16	those
17	present
18	,
19	the
20	late
21	Martin
22	Luther
23	King
24	's
25	famous
26	``
27	I
28	Have

32	speech
33	from
34	the
35	1963
36	March
37	on
38	Washington
39	.

1	Justice
2	Stevens
3	,
4	69
5	,
6	is
7	probably
8	the
9	most
10	philosophical
11	of
12	the
13	dissenters
14	about
15	his
16	role
17	,
18	in
19	part
20	because
21	he
22	may
23	be
24	the
25	least
26	liberal
27	of
28	the
29	four
30	,
31	but
32	also
33	because
34	he
35	enjoys
36	the
37	intellectual
38	challenge
39	of
40	arguing
41	with
42	the
43	majority
44	more
45	than
46	the
47	others
48	.

1	If
2	the
3	role
4	these
5	four
6	dissenters
7	are
8	assuming
9	is
10	a
11	familiar
12	one
13	in
14	modern
15	Supreme
16	Court
17	history
18	,
19	it
20	also
21	differs

25	way
26	from

9	the

11	RTC
12	transaction
13	with
14	a

1	Under

7	sells
8	just
9	the

15	.

1	These
2	``

5	transactions
6	leave
7	the

9	of
10	bad

16	,
17	with
18	the

20	,
21	to
22	be

24	later
25	.

1	In
2	these
3	four
4	,
5	for
6	instance
7	,
8	the
9	RTC
10	is
11	stuck
12	with
13	$
14	4.51
15	billion
16	in
17	bad
18	assets
19	.

1	Acquirers
2	paid

10	%
11	for

17	,
18	roughly
19	in
20	line
21	with
22	what
23	analysts
24	were
25	expecting
26	.

1	The
2	buyers
3	will
4	also
5	be
6	locked
7	into
8	deposit
9	rates
10	for
11	just
12	two

15	as
16	has
17	been
18	the
19	case
20	with

23	.

1	After

3	,
4	the

7	repudiate
8	the
9	rates
10	paid
11	by
12	the

15	.

1	But
2	it
3	's
4	uncertain
5	whether
6	these

9	take
10	those

18	,
19	and
20	in

22	,
23	rates
24	are

1	The

15	cash
16	by
17	certain
18	budgetary
19	deadlines
20	,
21	but
22	the

1	Mr.

1	The
2	branch
3	sale
4	is
5	the
6	centerpiece
7	of
8	CenTrust
9	's
10	strategy
11	to
12	transform
13	itself
14	into
15	a
16	traditional
17	S&L
18	from
19	a

35	.

1	Most
2	analysts
3	and

16	was
17	announced
18	in
19	July
20	,
21	long
22	before
23	now
24	.

1	Many
2	interpret
3	the
4	delay
5	as
6	an
7	indication
8	that
9	regulators
10	are
11	skeptical
12	about
13	the

15	.

1	Branches

1	CenTrust

3	however
4	,
5	touts
6	the

40	standards
41	.

1	CenTrust
2	said

1	Until

8	controlled

1	Since

3	costs
4	were
5	guaranteed
6	,
7	it
8	did
9	n't
10	matter
11	that
12	a

26	reached

7	or
8	none
9	of
10	the
11	people
12	upset
13	by
14	Mr.
15	Mason
16	's
17	remarks
18	have
19	bothered
20	to
21	distinguish
22	between
23	the
24	substance
25	of
26	his
27	comments
28	and
29	the
30	fact
31	that
32	he
33	used
34	insulting
35	language
36	.

1	In
2	addition
3	,
4	some
5	of
6	Mr.
7	Mason
8	's
9	critics
10	have
11	implied
12	that
13	his
14	type
15	of
16	ethnic
17	humor
18	is
19	itself
20	a
21	form
22	of
23	racism
24	.

1	For
2	example
3	,
4	the
5	New
6	York
7	state
8	counsel
9	for
10	the
11	NAACP
12	said
13	that
14	Mr.
15	Mason
16	is
17	``
18	like
19	a
20	dinosaur
21	.

1	People
2	are
3	fast
4	leaving
5	the
6	place
7	where
8	he
9	is
10	stuck
11	.
12	''

1	These
2	critics
3	fail
4	to
5	distinguish
6	between
7	the
8	type
9	of
10	ethnic
11	humor
12	that
13	aims
14	at
15	disparaging
16	another
17	group
18	,
19	such
20	as
21	``
22	Polish
23	jokes
24	''
25	;
26	and
27	the
28	type
29	that
30	is
31	double-edged
32	,
33	aiming
34	inward
35	as
36	well
37	as
38	outward
39	.

1	The
2	latter
3	typically
4	is
5	the
6	humor
7	of
8	the
9	underdog
10	,
11	and
12	it
13	was
14	perfected
15	by
16	both
17	blacks
18	and
19	Jews
20	on
21	the
22	minstrel
23	and
24	vaudeville
25	stage
26	as
27	a
28	means
29	of
30	mocking
31	their
32	white
33	and
34	gentile
35	audiences
36	along
37	with
38	themselves
39	.

1	In
2	the
3	hands
4	of
5	a
6	zealot
7	like
8	Lenny
9	Bruce
10	,
11	this
12	double-edged
13	blade
14	could
15	cut
16	both
17	the
18	self
19	and
20	the
21	audience
22	to
23	ribbons
24	.

1	But
2	wielded
3	by
4	a
5	pro
6	like
7	Jackie
8	Mason
9	,
10	it
11	is
12	a
13	constructive
14	form
15	of
16	mischief
17	.

1	Why
2	constructive
3	?

1	Because
2	despite
3	all
4	the
5	media
6	prattle
7	about
8	comedy
9	and
10	politics
11	not
12	mixing
13	,
14	they
15	are
16	similar
17	in
18	one
19	respect
20	:
21	Both
22	can
23	serve
24	as
25	mechanisms
26	for
27	easing
28	tensions
29	and
30	facilitating
31	the
32	co-existence
33	of
34	groups
35	in
36	conflict
37	.

1	That
2	's
3	why
4	it
5	's
6	dangerous
7	to
8	have
9	well-intentioned
10	thought
11	police
12	,
13	on
14	college
15	campuses
16	and
17	elsewhere
18	,
19	taboo
20	all
21	critical
22	mention
23	of
24	group
25	differences
26	.

1	As
2	Elizabeth
3	Kristol
4	wrote
5	in
6	the
7	New
8	York
9	Times
10	just
11	before
12	the
13	Mason
14	donnybrook
15	,
16	``
17	Perhaps
18	intolerance
19	would
20	not
21	boil
22	over
23	with
24	such
25	intensity
26	if
27	honest
28	differences
29	were
30	allowed
31	to
32	simmer
33	.
34	''

1	The
2	question
3	is
4	,
5	if
6	group
7	conflicts
8	still
9	exist
10	(
11	as
12	undeniably
13	they
14	do
15	)
16	,
17	and
18	if
19	Mr.
20	Mason
21	's
22	type
23	of
24	ethnic
25	humor
26	is
27	passe
28	,
29	then
30	what
31	other
32	means
33	do
34	we
35	have
36	for
37	letting
38	off
39	steam
40	?

1	Do
2	n't
3	say
4	the
5	TV
6	sitcom
7	,
8	because
9	that
10	happens
11	to
12	be
13	a
14	genre
15	that
16	,
17	in
18	its
19	desperate
20	need
21	to
22	attract
23	everybody
24	and
25	offend
26	nobody
27	,
28	resembles
29	politics
30	more
31	than
32	it
33	does
34	comedy
35	.

1	It
2	is
3	true
4	that
5	the
6	best
7	sitcoms
8	do
9	allow
10	group
11	differences
12	to
13	simmer
14	:
15	yuppies
16	vs.
17	blue-collar
18	Bostonians
19	in
20	``
21	Cheers
22	''
23	;
24	children
25	vs.
26	adults
27	in
28	``
29	The
30	Cosby
31	Show
32	.
33	''

1	But
2	these
3	are
4	not
5	the
6	differences
7	that
8	make
9	headlines
10	.

1	In
2	``
3	Chicken
4	Soup
5	,
6	''
7	Mr.
8	Mason
9	plays
10	Jackie
11	,
12	a
13	Jewish
14	bachelor
15	courting
16	Maddie
17	(
18	Lynn
19	Redgrave
20	)
21	,
22	an
23	Irish
24	widow
25	and
26	mother
27	of
28	three
29	,
30	against
31	the
32	wishes
33	of
34	his
35	mother
36	(
37	Rita
38	Karin
39	)
40	and
41	her
42	brother
43	Michael
44	(
45	Brandon
46	Maggart
47	)
48	.

1	It
2	's
3	worth
4	noting
5	that
6	both
7	disapproving
8	relatives
9	are
10	immigrants
11	.

1	At
2	least
3	,
4	they
5	both
6	speak
7	with
8	strong
9	accents
10	,
11	as
12	do
13	Jackie
14	and
15	Maddie
16	.

1	It
2	could
3	n't
4	be
5	more
6	obvious
7	that
8	``
9	Chicken
10	Soup
11	''
12	is
13	being
14	made
15	from
16	an
17	old
18	recipe
19	.

1	And
2	a
3	safe
4	one
5	--
6	imagine
7	if
8	the
9	romance
10	in
11	question
12	were
13	between
14	an
15	Orthodox
16	Jew
17	and
18	a
19	member
20	of
21	the
22	Nation
23	of
24	Islam
25	.

1	Back
2	in
3	the
4	1920s
5	,
6	the
7	play
8	and
9	movie
10	versions
11	of
12	``
13	Abie
14	's
15	Irish
16	Rose
17	''
18	made
19	the
20	theme
21	of
22	courtship
23	between
24	the
25	assimilated
26	offspring
27	of
28	Jewish
29	and
30	Irish
31	immigrants
32	so
33	popular
34	that
35	its
36	author
37	,
38	Anne
39	Nichols
40	,
41	lost
42	a
43	plagiarism
44	suit
45	on
46	the
47	grounds
48	that
49	the
50	plot
51	has
52	entered
53	the
54	public
55	domain
56	.

1	And
2	it
3	has
4	remained
5	there
6	,
7	as
8	evidenced
9	by
10	its
11	reappearance
12	in
13	a
14	1972
15	CBS
16	sitcom
17	called
18	``
19	Bridget
20	Loves
21	Bernie
22	,
23	''
24	whose
25	sole
26	distinction
27	was
28	that
29	it
30	led
31	to
32	the
33	real-life
34	marriage
35	of
36	Meredith
37	Baxter
38	and
39	David
40	Birney
41	.

1	Clearly
2	,
3	the
4	question
5	with
6	``
7	Chicken
8	Soup
9	''
10	is
11	not
12	whether
13	the
14	pot
15	will
16	boil
17	over
18	,
19	but
20	whether
21	it
22	will
23	simmer
24	at
25	all
26	.

1	So
2	far
3	,
4	the
5	bubbles
6	have
7	been
8	few
9	and
10	far
11	between
12	.

1	Part
2	of
3	the
4	problem
5	is
6	the
7	tendency
8	of
9	all
10	sitcoms
11	,
12	ever
13	since
14	the
15	didactic
16	days
17	of
18	Norman
19	Lear
20	,
21	to
22	preach
23	about
24	social
25	issues
26	.

1	To
2	some
3	extent
4	,
5	this
6	tendency
7	emerges
8	whenever
9	the
10	show
11	tries
12	to
13	enlighten
14	us
15	about
16	ethnic
17	stereotypes
18	by
19	reversing
20	them
21	.

1	For
2	instance
3	,
4	Michael
5	dislikes
6	Jackie
7	not
8	because
9	he
10	's
11	a
12	shrewd
13	Jewish
14	businessman
15	,
16	but
17	because
18	he
19	quits
20	his
21	well-paying
22	job
23	as
24	a
25	salesman
26	in
27	order
28	to
29	become
30	a
31	social
32	worker
33	.

1	Even
2	more
3	problematic
4	is
5	the
6	incompatibility
7	between
8	sitcom
9	preachiness
10	and
11	Mr.
12	Mason
13	's
14	comic
15	persona
16	.

1	The
2	best
3	moments
4	in
5	the
6	show
7	occur
8	at
9	the
10	beginning
11	and
12	the
13	end
14	(
15	and
16	occasionally
17	in
18	the
19	middle
20	)
21	,
22	when
23	Mr.
24	Mason
25	slips
26	into
27	his
28	standup
29	mode
30	and
31	starts
32	meting
33	out
34	that
35	old-fashioned
36	Jewish
37	mischief
38	to
39	other
40	people
41	as
42	well
43	as
44	to
45	himself
46	.

1	But
2	too
3	often
4	,
5	these
6	routines
7	lack
8	spark
9	because
10	this
11	sitcom
12	,
13	like
14	all
15	sitcoms
16	,
17	is
18	timid
19	about
20	confronting
21	Mr.
22	Mason
23	's
24	stock
25	in
26	trade
27	-
28	ethnic
29	differences
30	.

1	I
2	'm
3	not
4	suggesting
5	that
6	the
7	producers
8	start
9	putting
10	together
11	episodes
12	about
13	topics
14	like
15	the
16	Catholic-Jewish
17	dispute
18	over
19	the
20	Carmelite
21	convent
22	at
23	Auschwitz
24	.

1	That
2	issue
3	,
4	like
5	racial
6	tensions
7	in
8	New
9	York
10	City
11	,
12	will
13	have
14	to
15	cool
16	down
17	,
18	not
19	heat
20	up
21	,
22	before
23	it
24	can
25	simmer
26	.

1	But
2	I
3	am
4	suggesting
5	that
6	they
7	stop
8	requiring
9	Mr.
10	Mason
11	to
12	interrupt
13	his
14	classic
15	shtik
16	with
17	some
18	line
19	about
20	``
21	caring
22	for
23	other
24	people
25	''
26	that
27	would
28	sound
29	shmaltzy
30	on
31	the
32	lips
33	of
34	Miss
35	America
36	.

1	At
2	your
3	age
4	,
5	Jackie
6	,
7	you
8	ought
9	to
10	know
11	that
12	you
13	ca
14	n't
15	make
16	soup
17	without
18	turning
19	up
20	the
21	flame
22	.

1	Another
2	big
3	question
4	hovering
5	over
6	the
7	debate
8	is
9	what
10	President
11	Bush
12	thinks
13	.

1	He
2	has
3	been
4	resisting
5	a
6	stripped-down
7	bill
8	without
9	a
10	guaranteed
11	vote
12	on
13	his
14	capital-gains
15	tax
16	cut
17	.

1	But
2	Republican
3	senators
4	saw

6	way

9	a
10	procedural
11	hurdle

14	the

20	the
21	capital-gains
22	issue
23	on
24	the

26	,
27	so
28	they
29	went
30	ahead
31	with
32	the
33	streamlined
34	bill
35	.

1	The
2	Senate
3	bill
4	was
5	stripped
6	of
7	many
8	popular
9	,
10	though
11	revenue-losing
12	,
13	provisions
14	,
15	a
16	number
17	of
18	which
19	are
20	included
21	in
22	the
23	House-passed
24	bill
25	.

1	These
2	include
3	a
4	child-care
5	initiative
6	and
7	extensions
8	of
9	soon-to-expire
10	tax
11	breaks
12	for
13	low-income
14	housing

17	expenditures
18	.

1	Also
2	missing
3	from
4	the
5	Senate
6	bill
7	is
8	the
9	House
10	's
11	repeal
12	of
13	a
14	law
15	,
16	called
17	Section
18	89
19	,
20	that
21	compels
22	companies
23	to
24	give
25	rank-and-file

27	comparable
28	health
29	benefits
30	to

1	One
2	high-profile
3	provision
4	that
5	was
6	originally
7	in

10	bill
11	but

1	To
2	the
3	delight
4	of
5	some
6	doctors
7	,
8	the
9	bill
10	dropped
11	a
12	plan
13	passed
14	by

16	Finance
17	Committee
18	that
19	would

1	It

26	benefits
27	reduced

1	In
2	addition
3	,

14	%
15	excise
16	tax
17	on

1	It
2	no

26	to
27	reduce
28	their
29	tax
30	burden

1	It
2	also
3	drops

10	Occupational
11	Safety
12	and

1	Many
2	people
3	now
4	claim
5	to
6	have
7	predicted
8	the
9	1987
10	crash
11	.

1	Queens
2	newsletter
3	writer
4	Francis
5	X.
6	Curzio
7	actually
8	did
9	it
10	:
11	He
12	stated
13	in
14	writing
15	in
16	September
17	1987
18	that
19	the
20	Dow
21	Jones
22	Industrial
23	Average
24	was
25	likely
26	to
27	decline
28	about
29	500
30	points
31	the
32	following
33	month
34	.

1	Mr.
2	Curzio
3	says
4	what
5	happens
6	now
7	will
8	depend
9	a
10	good
11	deal
12	on

15	of
16	the

18	Subcommittee
19	on
20	Employment
21	and

24	alleging
25	:

1	1
2	.
3	That
4	your
5	Sept.
6	28
7	editorial
8	``
9	Kangaroo
10	Committees
11	''
12	was
13	factually
14	inaccurate
15	and
16	deliberately
17	misleading
18	.

1	I
2	thought
3	your
4	editorial
5	was
6	factually
7	accurate
8	and
9	deliberately
10	elucidative
11	.

1	2
2	.
3	That
4	Mr.
5	Lantos
6	supported
7	the
8	rights
9	of
10	the
11	witnesses
12	to
13	take
14	the
15	Fifth
16	Amendment
17	.

1	Yes
2	,
3	he
4	did
5	.

1	As
2	I
3	watched
4	him
5	on
6	C-Span
7	,
8	I
9	heard
10	him
11	speak
12	those
13	lovely
14	words
15	about
16	the
17	Bill
18	of
19	Rights
20	,
21	which
22	he
23	quotes
24	from
25	the
26	transcript
27	of
28	the
29	hearings
30	.

1	He
2	did
3	repeat
4	those
5	nice
6	platitudes
7	several
8	times
9	as
10	an
11	indication
12	of
13	his
14	support
15	for
16	the
17	Constitution
18	.

1	He
2	used
3	about
4	56
5	words
6	defending
7	the
8	witnesses
9	'
10	constitutional
11	rights
12	.

1	Unfortunately
2	,
3	by
4	my
5	rough
6	guess
7	,
8	he
9	used
10	better
11	than
12	5,000
13	words
14	heaping
15	scorn
16	on
17	the
18	witnesses
19	for
20	exercising
21	the
22	Fifth
23	.

1	He
2	sandwiched
3	his
4	praise
5	of
6	constitutional
7	meat
8	between
9	large
10	loaves
11	of
12	bilious
13	commentary
14	.

1	As
2	your
3	editorial
4	rightly
5	pointed
6	out
7	,
8	Samuel
9	Pierce
10	,
11	former
12	HUD
13	secretary
14	,
15	and

1	My

5	fully
6	realize

8	are

1	Absolute

1	By
2	any
3	``
4	reasonable
5	man
6	''
7	criterion
8	,
9	Mr.
10	Lantos
11	and
12	his
13	colleagues
14	have
15	a
16	whole
17	bunch
18	of
19	people
20	tried
21	and
22	convicted
23	.

1	Apparently
2	,
3	their
4	verdict
5	is
6	in
7	.

1	Right
2	now
3	they
4	're
5	pursuing
6	evidence
7	.

1	That
2	's
3	not
4	a
5	bad
6	way
7	to
8	proceed
9	,
10	just
11	somewhat
12	different
13	from
14	standard
15	American
16	practice
17	.

1	How
2	was
3	that
4	practice
5	referred
6	to
7	when
8	I
9	was
10	in
11	school
12	?

1	Ah
2	,
3	yes
4	,
5	something
6	called
7	a
8	Star
9	Chamber
10	.

1	Of
2	course
3	,
4	Mr.
5	Lantos
6	doth
7	protest
8	that
9	his
10	subcommittee
11	simply
12	seeks
13	information
14	for
15	legislative
16	change
17	.

1	No
2	doubt
3	that
4	's
5	partially
6	true
7	.

1	Everything
2	that
3	Mr.
4	Lantos
5	says
6	in
7	his
8	letter
9	is
10	partially
11	true
12	.

1	He
2	's
3	right
4	about
5	his
6	subcommittee
7	's
8	responsibilities
9	when
10	it
11	comes
12	to
13	obtaining
14	information
15	from
16	prior
17	HUD
18	officials
19	.

1	But
2	if
3	his
4	explanation
5	of
6	motivation
7	is
8	true
9	,
10	why
11	is
12	his
13	investigation
14	so
15	oriented
16	as
17	to
18	identify
19	criminal
20	activity
21	?

1	Why
2	not
3	simply
4	questions
5	designed
6	to
7	identify
8	sources
9	and
10	causes
11	of
12	waste
13	and
14	inefficiency
15	?

1	Such
2	as
3	,
4	what
5	happened
6	when
7	Congress
8	wanted
9	to
10	know
11	about
12	$
13	400
14	toilet
15	seats
16	or
17	whatever
18	they
19	supposedly
20	cost

1	No
2	,
3	Mr.
4	Lantos

6	complaints
7	simply
8	wo
9	n't
10	wash

1	The
2	problem
3	,
4	which
5	the
6	Journal
7	so
8	rightly
9	pointed
10	out
11	in
12	a
13	number
14	of
15	articles
16	,
17	is
18	not
19	the
20	likes
21	of
22	Mr.
23	Lantos
24	,
25	who
26	after
27	all
28	is
29	really
30	a
31	bit
32	player
33	on
34	the
35	stage
36	,
37	but
38	the
39	attempt
40	by
41	Congress
42	to
43	enhance
44	itself
45	into
46	a
47	quasi-parliamentary\/judicial
48	body
49	.

1	(
2	Of
3	course
4	,
5	we
6	've
7	also
8	got
9	a
10	judiciary
11	that
12	seeks
13	the
14	same
15	objective
16	.
17	)

1	The
2	system
3	is
4	the
5	problem
6	,
7	not
8	an
9	individual
10	member
11	.

1	Individuals
2	can
3	always
4	have
5	their
6	hands
7	slapped
8	.

1	It
2	's
3	when
4	such
5	slapping
6	does
7	n't
8	occur
9	that
10	we
11	've
12	got
13	trouble
14	.

1	I
2	do
3	not
4	by
5	any
6	means
7	defend
8	HUD
9	management
10	.

1	But
2	I
3	think
4	the
5	kind
6	of
7	congressional
8	investigation
9	that
10	has
11	been
12	pursued
13	is
14	a
15	far
16	greater
17	danger
18	to
19	American
20	notions
21	of
22	liberty
23	and
24	freedom
25	than
26	any
27	incompetency
28	(
29	and
30	,
31	yes
32	,
33	maybe
34	criminality
35	)
36	within
37	HUD
38	could
39	possibly
40	generate
41	.

1	The
2	last
3	time
4	I
5	saw
6	a
7	similar
8	congressional
9	hearing
10	was
11	when
12	``
13	Tail
14	Gunner
15	Joe
16	''
17	McCarthy
18	did
19	his
20	work
21	.

1	Raymond
2	Weber

1	Parsippany
2	,
3	N.J
4	.

1	I
2	disagree
3	with
4	the
5	statement
6	by
7	Mr.
8	Lantos
9	that
10	one
11	should
12	not
13	draw
14	an
15	adverse
16	inference
17	against
18	former
19	HUD
20	officials
21	who
22	assert
23	their
24	Fifth
25	Amendment
26	privilege
27	against
28	self-incrimination
29	in
30	congressional
31	hearings
32	.

1	The
2	Fifth
3	Amendment
4	states
5	in
6	relevant
7	part
8	that
9	no
10	person
11	``
12	shall
13	be
14	compelled
15	,
16	in
17	any
18	criminal
19	case
20	,
21	to
22	be
23	a
24	witness
25	against
26	himself
27	.
28	''

1	This
2	privilege
3	against
4	self-incrimination
5	precludes
6	the
7	drawing
8	of
9	an
10	adverse
11	inference
12	against
13	a
14	criminal
15	defendant
16	who
17	chooses
18	not
19	to
20	testify
21	.

1	Thus
2	,
3	in
4	a
5	criminal
6	case
7	,
8	a
9	prosecutor
10	can
11	not
12	comment
13	on
14	a
15	defendant
16	's
17	failure
18	to
19	testify
20	nor
21	can
22	the
23	defendant
24	be
25	compelled
26	to
27	take
28	the
29	stand
30	as
31	a
32	witness
33	,
34	thus
35	forcing
36	him
37	to
38	``
39	take
40	the
41	Fifth
42	.
43	''

1	The
2	privilege
3	,
4	however
5	,
6	has
7	been
8	limited
9	in
10	accordance
11	with
12	its
13	plain
14	language
15	to
16	protect
17	the
18	defendant
19	in
20	criminal
21	matters
22	only
23	.

1	The
2	Supreme
3	Court
4	and
5	some
6	states
7	have
8	specifically
9	recognized
10	that
11	``
12	the
13	Fifth
14	Amendment
15	does
16	not
17	preclude
18	the
19	inference
20	where
21	the
22	privilege
23	is
24	claimed
25	by

1	Joseph

3	,
4	president
5	of
6	the
7	National
8	Association
9	of

13	which
14	oversees
15	the
16	Nasdaq
17	computerized
18	trading
19	system
20	,
21	said
22	that
23	despite
24	the
25	rush
26	of
27	selling
28	,
29	he
30	never
31	considered
32	the
33	situation
34	an
35	``
36	emergency
37	.
38	''

1	``
2	The
3	pace
4	of
5	trading
6	was
7	orderly
8	,
9	''
10	he
11	said
12	.

1	Nasdaq

3	Small
4	Order
5	Execution
6	System
7	``

12	as
13	did
14	the
15	automated
16	system
17	for
18	larger
19	trades
20	,
21	according
22	to
23	Mr.
24	Hardiman
25	.

1	Nevertheless
2	,
3	the
4	shock
5	of
6	another
7	steep
8	plunge
9	in
10	stock
11	prices
12	undoubtedly
13	will
14	shake
15	many
16	investors
17	'
18	confidence
19	.

1	In
2	the
3	past
4	,
5	the
6	OTC
7	market
8	thrived
9	on
10	a
11	firm
12	base
13	of
14	small-investor
15	participation
16	.

1	Because
2	Nasdaq
3	's
4	trading
5	volume
6	has
7	n't
8	returned
9	to
10	pre-crash
11	levels
12	,
13	traders
14	and
15	OTC

17	officials
18	hope

1	But
2	they

1	More
2	troubling

4	the

6	that
7	the

10	in

1	The

13	because
14	the

3	hours
4	later

6	the

12	.

1	Politicians
2	tried
3	to
4	finger
5	each
6	other
7	for
8	the
9	blame
10	,
11	although
12	many
13	analysts
14	doubt
15	that
16	Washington

18	singly
19	responsible
20	for

1	But
2	Mr.

4	's
5	comments
6	make
7	one
8	thing
9	clear
10	:
11	Some
12	on

15	wonder
16	if
17	anyone
18	is
19	in

1	The

1	--
2	The
3	administration
4	has
5	sent
6	out
7	confusing
8	signals
9	about
10	its
11	response
12	to
13	a
14	recent
15	spate
16	of
17	airline
18	takeovers
19	.

1	Last
2	month
3	,
4	Transportation
5	Secretary
6	Sam
7	Skinner
8	forced
9	Northwest
10	Airlines
11	to
12	reduce
13	a
14	stake
15	held
16	by
17	KLM
18	Royal
19	Dutch
20	Airlines
21	.

1	But
2	he
3	has
4	since
5	run
6	into
7	opposition
8	from
9	the
10	Treasury
11	and
12	the
13	White
14	House
15	over
16	that
17	decision
18	.

1	And
2	he
3	has
4	kept
5	mum
6	on
7	how
8	his
9	decision
10	might
11	affect
12	a
13	bid
14	for
15	United
16	Airlines
17	,
18	which
19	includes
20	a
21	big
22	stake
23	by
24	British
25	Airways
26	PLC
27	.

1	Some
2	analysts
3	say
4	uncertainty
5	about
6	Washington
7	's
8	anti-takeover
9	policy
10	was
11	one
12	reason
13	that
14	financing
15	for
16	the
17	United
18	Airlines
19	takeover
20	fell
21	through
22	--
23	the
24	event
25	that
26	triggered
27	the
28	market
29	drop
30	.

1	In
2	many
3	ways
4	,
5	the
6	backdrop
7	to
8	Friday
9	's
10	stock
11	decline
12	is
13	eerily
14	similar
15	to
16	that
17	of
18	October
19	1987
20	's
21	508-point
22	crash
23	.

1	Then
2	,
3	as
4	now
5	,
6	the
7	budget
8	debate
9	was
10	behind
11	schedule
12	and
13	automatic
14	spending
15	cuts
16	were
17	within
18	days
19	of
20	taking
21	hold
22	.

1	The
2	Treasury
3	was
4	locked
5	in
6	a
7	battle
8	over
9	international
10	economic
11	policy
12	,
13	although
14	at
15	that
16	time
17	it
18	was
19	with
20	West
21	German
22	officials
23	rather
24	than
25	the
26	Federal
27	Reserve
28	.

1	And
2	concern
3	about
4	official
5	actions
6	aimed
7	at
8	takeovers
9	--
10	then
11	by
12	the
13	tax-writing
14	House
15	Ways
16	and
17	Means
18	Committee
19	rather
20	than
21	the
22	Transportation
23	Department
24	--
25	were
26	making
27	markets
28	nervous
29	.

1	The
2	1987
3	crash
4	brought
5	the
6	Reagan
7	administration
8	and
9	Democratic
10	lawmakers
11	to
12	the
13	table
14	for
15	the
16	first
17	budget
18	summit
19	,
20	resulting
21	in
22	a
23	two-year

1	That
2	's
3	because
4	their

6	can
7	require
8	them

1	In

3	1987
4	,
5	these
6	margin
7	calls
8	were
9	thought
10	to

14	the

16	spiral
17	of
18	the

20	market
21	.

1	Typically

16	the

24	.

1	The
2	resulting
3	decline
4	in
5	interest
6	rates
7	and
8	the
9	value
10	of
11	the
12	dollar
13	could
14	reinvigorate
15	American
16	business
17	--
18	indeed
19	,
20	the
21	entire
22	economy
23	.

1	This
2	may
3	sound
4	strangely
5	optimistic
6	.

1	After
2	all
3	,
4	until
5	a
6	few
7	years
8	ago
9	,
10	the
11	stock
12	market
13	was
14	viewed
15	as
16	a
17	barometer
18	of
19	the
20	national
21	economy
22	.

1	When
2	it
3	went
4	down
5	,
6	by
7	all
8	tradition
9	,
10	the
11	economy
12	followed
13	.

1	That
2	has
3	changed
4	,
5	partly
6	because
7	the
8	two
9	years
10	following
11	the
12	worst
13	stock-market
14	plunge
15	in

17	have
18	been
19	reasonably
20	comfortable
21	.

1	The

17	of

1	The

4	increasingly
5	disconnected
6	from

1	Of

14	discourage
15	the
16	foreign

18	upon

20	the
21	U.S.
22	now
23	relies

1	The
2	financial-services

10	.

1	What

3	more
4	,
5	although
6	the

10	far
11	less
12	overvalued
13	today
14	than
15	two

18	,
19	the

2	if
3	the

7	n't
8	continue
9	to

11	,
12	the
13	beneficial

15	of
16	lower
17	interest
18	rates
19	and
20	a

1	Fed

10	mean

12	fundamental
13	change
14	in

1	But
2	the
3	experience
4	of
5	the
6	1987
7	crash
8	suggests
9	the
10	Fed
11	is
12	likely
13	to
14	bring
15	down
16	short-term
17	interest
18	rates
19	in

1	Anticipating
2	the
3	Fed
4	's
5	move
6	,
7	money
8	traders
9	lowered
10	a

9	what
10	banks
11	charge
12	each

17	,
18	are
19	usually
20	among

22	few
23	visible

25	that
26	the
27	Fed
28	leaves
29	on
30	the

32	markets
33	.

1	The
2	dollar
3	also
4	began
5	to
6	decline
7	Friday
8	as
9	the
10	stock
11	market
12	's
13	plunge
14	caused
15	some
16	investors
17	to
18	reassess
19	their
20	desire
21	to
22	invest
23	in
24	the
25	U.S.
26	.

1	Treasury
2	officials
3	have
4	been
5	arguing
6	for
7	months
8	that
9	the
10	dollar
11	's
12	strength
13	was
14	out
15	of
16	whack
17	with
18	economic
19	fundamentals
20	,
21	threatening
22	to
23	extinguish
24	the
25	export
26	boom
27	that
28	has
29	sustained
30	manufacturers
31	for
32	several
33	years
34	.

1	The
2	market
3	drop
4	has
5	now
6	apparently
7	convinced
8	foreign
9	investors
10	that
11	the
12	Treasury
13	was
14	right
15	about
16	the
17	overpriced
18	dollar
19	.

1	A
2	modest
3	drop
4	in
5	the
6	dollar
7	--
8	only
9	a
10	modest
11	one
12	,
13	mind
14	you
15	--
16	would
17	be
18	welcomed
19	by
20	the
21	U.S.
22	.

1	That
2	was
3	n't
4	the
5	case
6	in
7	1987
8	,
9	when
10	the
11	dollar
12	was
13	so
14	weak
15	that
16	some
17	economists
18	and
19	government
20	officials
21	seriously
22	worried
23	that
24	it
25	might
26	collapse
27	,
28	producing
29	panic
30	among
31	foreign
32	investors
33	and
34	diminishing
35	the
36	flow
37	of
38	foreign
39	capital
40	to
41	the
42	U.S.
43	.

1	Another
2	big
3	difference
4	between
5	1987
6	and
7	1989
8	is
9	n't
10	so
11	comforting
12	.

1	In
2	the
3	third
4	quarter
5	of
6	1987
7	,
8	the
9	economy
10	spurted
11	at
12	an
13	inflation-adjusted
14	annual
15	rate
16	of
17	5.3
18	%
19	.

1	The
2	consensus
3	among
4	economists
5	is
6	that
7	it
8	grew
9	a
10	much
11	more
12	sluggish
13	2.3
14	%
15	in
16	the
17	third
18	quarter
19	of
20	1989
21	,
22	which
23	ended
24	two
25	weeks
26	ago
27	.

2	plunge

11	n't
12	recession

15	reasons

13	n't
14	move

1	The

10	confidence
11	of

16	a

10	--
11	well
12	,
13	the
14	dollar
15	's
16	recent

25	.

1	On

10	for

18	Depression
19	.

1	The
2	doomsayers

5	receptive
6	audience
7	.

1	The

5	Black
6	Monday
7	permits
8	a
9	more
10	optimistic
11	view
12	today

3	very

9	to
10	realize
11	the
12	prospectus
13	is
14	guilty
15	of
16	less
17	than
18	full
19	disclosure
20	.

1	The
2	slickly
3	produced
4	series
5	has
6	been
7	criticized
8	by
9	London
10	's
11	financial
12	cognoscenti
13	as
14	inaccurate
15	in
16	detail
17	,
18	but
19	its
20	major
21	weakness
22	is
23	its
24	unrealistic
25	depiction
26	of
27	the
28	characters
29	'
30	professional
31	and
32	private
33	lives
34	.

1	Turned
2	loose
3	in
4	Shane
5	Longman
6	's
7	trading
8	room
9	,
10	the
11	yuppie
12	dealers
13	do
14	little
15	right
16	.

1	Judging
2	by
3	the
4	money
5	lost
6	and
7	mistakes
8	made
9	in
10	the
11	early
12	episodes
13	,
14	Shane
15	Longman
16	's
17	capital
18	should
19	be
20	just
21	about
22	exhausted
23	by
24	the
25	final
26	13th
27	week
28	.

1	In
2	the
3	opening
4	episode
5	we
6	learn
7	that
8	Michelle
9	,
10	a
11	junior
12	bond
13	trader
14	,
15	has
16	indeed
17	pulled
18	off
19	another
20	million
21	before
22	lunch
23	.

1	Trouble
2	is
3	,
4	she
5	has
6	lost
7	it
8	just
9	as
10	quickly
11	.

1	Rather
2	than
3	keep
4	the
5	loss
6	a
7	secret
8	from
9	the
10	outside
11	world
12	,
13	Michelle
14	blabs
15	about
16	it
17	to
18	a
19	sandwich
20	man
21	while
22	ordering
23	lunch
24	over
25	the
26	phone
27	.

1	Little
2	chance
3	that
4	Shane
5	Longman
6	is
7	going
8	to
9	recoup
10	today
11	.

1	Traders
2	spend
3	the
4	morning
5	frantically
6	selling
7	bonds
8	,
9	in
10	the
11	belief
12	that
13	the
14	U.S.
15	monthly
16	trade
17	figures
18	will
19	look
20	lousy
21	.

1	Ah
2	,
3	perfidious
4	Columbia
5	!

1	The
2	trade
3	figures
4	turn
5	out
6	well
7	,
8	and
9	all
10	those
11	recently
12	unloaded
13	bonds
14	spurt
15	in
16	price
17	.

1	So
2	much
3	for
4	anticipating
5	the
6	market
7	by
8	a
9	fraction
10	of
11	a
12	second
13	.

1	And
2	a
3	large
4	slice
5	of
6	the
7	first
8	episode
9	is
10	devoted
11	to
12	efforts
13	to
14	get
15	rid
16	of
17	some
18	nearly
19	worthless
20	Japanese
21	bonds
22	(
23	since
24	when
25	is
26	anything
27	Japanese
28	nearly
29	worthless
30	nowadays
31	?
32	)
33	.

1	Surprisingly
2	,
3	Shane
4	Longman
5	survives
6	the
7	week
8	,
9	only
10	to
11	have
12	a
13	senior
14	executive
15	innocently
16	bumble
17	his
18	way
19	into
20	becoming
21	the
22	target
23	of
24	a
25	criminal
26	insider
27	trading
28	investigation
29	.

1	Instead
2	of
3	closing
4	ranks
5	to
6	protect
7	the
8	firm
9	's
10	reputation
11	,
12	the
13	executive
14	's
15	internal
16	rivals
17	,
18	led
19	by
20	a
21	loutish
22	American
23	,
24	demand
25	his
26	resignation
27	.

1	The
2	plot
3	is
4	thwarted
5	when
6	the
7	firm
8	's
9	major
10	stockholder
11	,
12	kelp
13	farming
14	on
15	the
16	other
17	side
18	of
19	the
20	globe
21	,
22	hurries
23	home
24	to
25	support
26	the
27	executive
28	.

1	But
2	the
3	investigation
4	continues
5	.

1	If
2	you
3	can
4	swallow
5	the
6	premise
7	that
8	the
9	rewards
10	for
11	such
12	ineptitude
13	are
14	six-figure
15	salaries
16	,
17	you
18	still
19	are
20	left
21	puzzled
22	,
23	because
24	few
25	of
26	the
27	yuppies
28	consume
29	very
30	conspicuously
31	.

1	In
2	fact
3	,
4	few
5	consume
6	much
7	of
8	anything
9	.

1	Two
2	share
3	a
4	house
5	almost
6	devoid
7	of
8	furniture
9	.

1	Michelle
2	lives
3	in
4	a
5	hotel
6	room
7	,
8	and
9	although
10	she
11	drives
12	a
13	canary-colored
14	Porsche
15	,
16	she
17	has
18	n't
19	time
20	to
21	clean
22	or
23	repair
24	it
25	;
26	the
27	beat-up
28	vehicle
29	can
30	be
31	started
32	only
33	with
34	a
35	huge
36	pair
37	of
38	pliers
39	because
40	the
41	ignition
42	key
43	has
44	broken
45	off
46	in
47	the
48	lock
49	.

1	And
2	it
3	takes
4	Declan
5	,
6	the
7	obligatory
8	ladies
9	'
10	man
11	of
12	the
13	cast
14	,
15	until
16	the
17	third
18	episode
19	to
20	get
21	past
22	first
23	base
24	with
25	any
26	of
27	his
28	prey
29	.

1	Perhaps
2	the
3	explanation
4	for
5	these
6	anomalies
7	is
8	that
9	class-conscious
10	Britain
11	is
12	n't
13	ready
14	to
15	come
16	to
17	terms
18	with
19	the
20	wealth
21	created
22	by
23	the
24	Thatcherian
25	free-enterprise
26	regime
27	.

1	After
2	all
3	,
4	this
5	is
6	n't
7	old
8	money
9	,
10	but
11	new
12	money
13	,
14	and
15	in
16	many
17	cases
18	,
19	young
20	money
21	.

1	This
2	attitude
3	is
4	clearly
5	illustrated
6	in
7	the
8	treatment
9	of
10	Max
11	,
12	the
13	trading
14	room
15	's
16	most
17	flamboyant
18	character
19	.

1	Yuppily
2	enough
3	,
4	he
5	lives
6	in
7	a
8	lavishly
9	furnished
10	converted
11	church
12	,
13	wears
14	designer
15	clothes
16	and
17	drives
18	an
19	antique
20	car
21	.

1	But
2	apparently
3	to
4	make
5	him
6	palatable
7	,
8	even
9	lovable
10	,
11	to
12	the
13	masses
14	,
15	the
16	script
17	inflates
18	pony-tailed
19	Max
20	into
21	an
22	eccentric
23	genius
24	,
25	master
26	of
27	11
28	Chinese
29	dialects
30	.

1	He
2	takes
3	his
4	wash
5	to
6	the
7	laundromat
8	,
9	where
10	he
11	meets
12	a
13	punky
14	French
15	girl
16	who
17	dupes
18	him
19	into
20	providing
21	a
22	home
23	for
24	her
25	pet
26	piranha
27	and
28	then
29	promptly
30	steals
31	his
32	car
33	and
34	dumps
35	it
36	in
37	Dieppe
38	.

1	In
2	producing
3	and
4	promoting
5	``
6	Capital
7	City
8	,
9	''
10	Thames
11	has
12	spent
13	about
14	as
15	much
16	as
17	Shane
18	Longman
19	loses
20	on
21	a
22	good
23	day
24	.

1	The
2	production
3	costs
4	are
5	a
6	not
7	inconsiderable
8	#
9	8
10	million
11	(
12	$
13	12.4
14	million
15	)
16	,
17	and
18	would
19	have
20	been
21	much
22	higher
23	had
24	not
25	the
26	cost
27	of
28	the
29	trading
30	floor
31	set
32	been
33	absorbed
34	in
35	the
36	budget
37	of
38	``
39	Dealers
40	,
41	''
42	an
43	earlier
44	made-for-TV
45	movie
46	.

1	Another
2	half
3	million
4	quid
5	went
6	for
7	a
8	volley
9	of
10	full-page
11	advertisements
12	in
13	six
14	major
15	British
16	newspapers
17	and
18	for
19	huge
20	posters
21	in
22	the
23	London
24	subway
25	.

1	These
2	expenses
3	create
4	a
5	special
6	incentive
7	for
8	``
9	Capital
10	City
11	's
12	''
13	producers
14	to
15	flog
16	it
17	,
18	or
19	a
20	Yank-oriented
21	version
22	of
23	it
24	,
25	in
26	America
27	.

1	Thames
2	's
3	U.S.
4	marketing
5	agent
6	,
7	Donald
8	Taffner
9	,
10	is
11	preparing
12	to
13	do
14	just
15	that
16	.

1	He
2	is
3	discreetly
4	hopeful
5	,
6	citing
7	three
8	U.S.
9	comedy
10	series

28	Out
29	''
30	--
31	that
32	had
33	British
34	antecedents
35	.

1	Perhaps
2	without
3	realizing
4	it
5	,
6	Mr.
7	Taffner
8	simultaneously
9	has
10	put
11	his
12	finger
13	on
14	the
15	problem
16	and
17	an
18	ideal
19	solution
20	:
21	``
22	Capital
23	City
24	''
25	should
26	have
27	been
28	a
29	comedy

31	a
32	worthy

34	to
35	the

37	British

42	movies
43	of

45	1960s
46	.

1	The
2	seeds
3	already
4	are
5	in
6	the
7	script
8	.

1	The
2	first
3	episode
4	concluded
5	with
6	a
7	marvelously
8	cute
9	scene
10	in
11	which
12	the
13	trading-room
14	crew
15	minded
16	a
17	baby
18	,
19	the
20	casualty
21	of
22	a
23	broken
24	marriage
25	at
26	the

28	.

1	And
2	many
3	in

7	bear
8	striking
9	resemblances
10	to

12	TV
13	and
14	movie
15	personalities
16	known
17	for

39	Tommy

42	Dorian

6	everybody
7	on
8	stage
9	for
10	``
11	Carry

15	:
16	The

19	frantically
20	searching
21	the
22	office
23	for
24	misplaced
25	Japanese
26	bonds
27	that
28	suddenly

38	just
39	bought

8	agent
9	of
10	imperialism
11	,
12	Radio
13	Free

1	The
2	disease
3	metaphor
4	comes
5	to
6	mind
7	,
8	of
9	course
10	,
11	not
12	as
13	an
14	aspersion
15	on
16	the
17	advocates
18	of
19	national
20	service
21	.

1	Rather
2	,
3	it
4	is
5	born
6	of
7	frustration
8	with
9	having
10	to
11	combat
12	constantly
13	changing
14	strains
15	of
16	a
17	statist
18	idea
19	that
20	one
21	thought
22	had
23	been
24	eliminated

26	the
27	early
28	1970s
29	,
30	along
31	with

26	a
27	proposal
28	with
29	a
30	serious
31	shot
32	at
33	congressional
34	passage
35	this
36	fall
37	.

1	Why
2	does
3	the
4	national-service
5	virus
6	keep
7	coming
8	back
9	?

1	Perhaps
2	it
3	is
4	because
5	utopian
6	nostalgia
7	evokes
8	both
9	military
10	experience
11	and
12	the
13	social
14	gospel
15	.

1	If
2	only
3	we
4	could
5	get
6	America
7	's
8	wastrel
9	youth
10	into
11	at
12	least
13	a
14	psychic
15	uniform
16	we
17	might
18	be
19	able
20	to
21	teach
22	self-discipline
23	again
24	and
25	revive
26	the
27	spirit
28	of
29	giving
30	.

1	A
2	quarter
3	of
4	a
5	century
6	ago
7	national
8	service
9	was
10	promoted
11	as
12	a
13	way
14	of
15	curing
16	the
17	manifest
18	inequities
19	of
20	the
21	draft
22	--
23	by
24	,
25	of
26	all
27	things
28	,
29	expanding
30	the
31	draft
32	.

1	Those
2	of
3	us
4	who
5	resisted
6	the
7	idea
8	then
9	suspect
10	today
11	that
12	an
13	obligation
14	of
15	government
16	service
17	for
18	all
19	young
20	people
21	is
22	still
23	the
24	true
25	long-term
26	aim
27	of
28	many
29	national-service
30	backers
31	,
32	despite
33	their
34	protests
35	that
36	present
37	plans
38	contain
39	no
40	coercion
41	.

1	Choice
2	of
3	the
4	volunteer
5	military
6	in
7	the
8	1970s
9	seemed
10	to
11	doom
12	national
13	service
14	as
15	much
16	as
17	the
18	draft
19	.

1	But
2	the
3	virus
4	was
5	kept
6	alive
7	in
8	sociology
9	departments
10	until
11	a
12	couple
13	of
14	years
15	ago
16	,
17	when
18	it
19	again
20	was
21	let
22	loose
23	.

1	This
2	time
3	it
4	attempted
5	to
6	invade
7	two
8	connected
9	problems
10	,
11	the
12	rising
13	cost
14	of
15	higher
16	education
17	and
18	the
19	rising
20	expense
21	to
22	the
23	federal
24	government
25	of
26	educational
27	grants
28	and
29	loans
30	.

1	Why
2	not
3	keep
4	and
5	even
6	expand
7	the
8	loans
9	and
10	grants
11	,
12	the
13	advocates
14	reasoned
15	,
16	but
17	require
18	some
19	form
20	of
21	service
22	from
23	each
24	recipient
25	?

1	Military
2	service
3	,
4	moreover
5	,
6	could
7	be
8	a
9	national-service
10	option
11	.

1	Thus
2	,
3	undoubtedly
4	it
5	was
6	hoped
7	that
8	the
9	new
10	strain
11	of
12	national
13	service
14	would
15	prove
16	contagious
17	,
18	infecting
19	patriotic
20	conservatives
21	,
22	pay-as-you-go
23	moderates
24	,
25	and
26	idealistic
27	liberals
28	.

1	The
2	Democratic
3	Leadership
4	Council
5	,
6	a
7	centrist
8	group
9	sponsoring
10	the
11	plan
12	,
13	surely
14	thought
15	it
16	might
17	help
18	the
19	party
20	to
21	attract
22	support
23	,
24	especially
25	among
26	college
27	students
28	and
29	their
30	parents
31	.

1	A
2	provision
3	allowing
4	grants
5	to
6	be
7	applied
8	to
9	first-home
10	purchases
11	was
12	added
13	to
14	appeal
15	to
16	those
17	who
18	had
19	had
20	enough
21	of
22	schooling
23	.

1	The
2	DLC
3	plan
4	envisaged
5	``

9	trees
10	,
11	emptying
12	bedpans
13	,
14	tutoring
15	children

17	and
18	assisting
19	librarians
20	for

24	week
25	,
26	tax
27	free
28	,
29	plus
30	medical
31	care
32	.

1	With
2	a
3	tax-free
4	$
5	10,000
6	voucher
7	payment
8	at
9	the
10	end
11	of
12	each
13	year
14	,
15	the
16	volunteers
17	would
18	be
19	making
20	a
21	wage
22	comparable
23	to
24	$
25	17,500
26	a
27	year
28	.

1	Mind
2	you
3	,
4	most
5	of
6	``
7	the
8	volunteers
9	''
10	would
11	be
12	unskilled
13	17

15	to
16	18-year-olds
17	,
18	some
19	not
20	even
21	high
22	school
23	graduates
24	,
25	and
26	many
27	saving
28	money
29	by
30	living
31	at
32	home
33	.

1	They
2	would
3	be
4	doing
5	better
6	financially
7	under
8	national
9	service
10	than
11	many
12	taxpayers
13	working
14	at
15	the
16	same
17	kinds
18	of
19	jobs
20	and
21	perhaps
22	supporting
23	families
24	.

1	As
2	it
3	happened
4	,
5	political
6	resistance
7	developed
8	among
9	educational
10	and
11	minority
12	interests
13	that
14	count
15	on
16	the
17	present
18	education
19	grant
20	system
21	,
22	so
23	the
24	national-service
25	devotees
26	decided
27	to
28	abandon
29	the
30	supposedly
31	crucial
32	principle
33	of

1	The

1	Is

1	On

4	,
5	it

1	If

1	What

9	start

10	jobs
11	in
12	hospitals
13	,
14	for
15	example
16	,
17	we
18	should
19	raise
20	pay
21	,
22	pursue
23	labor-saving
24	technology
25	,
26	or
27	allow
28	more
29	legal
30	immigration
31	,
32	rather
33	than
34	overpay
35	high
36	school
37	graduates
38	as
39	short-term
40	workers
41	and
42	cause
43	resentment
44	among
45	permanent
46	workers
47	paid
48	lesser
49	amounts
50	to
51	do
52	the
53	same
54	jobs
55	.

1	Will
2	national
3	service
4	,
5	in
6	the
7	current
8	highly
9	politicized
10	and
11	opportunistic

15	appeal
16	to
17	get

1	Not
2	necessarily
3	.

1	Polls
2	show
3	wide
4	,
5	generalized
6	support
7	for
8	some
9	vague
10	concept

1	So
2	far
3	,
4	the
5	president
6	seems
7	ill-disposed
8	to
9	substitute
10	any
11	of
12	the

15	his

1	However
2	,
3	even
4	this

38	been
39	reported
40	out
41	of
42	the
43	Senate
44	Labor
45	Committee
46	.

1	It
2	might
3	well
4	win
5	Senate
6	passage
7	.

1	President
2	Bush
3	has

10	(
11	YES

14	,
15	though
16	its
17	details
18	remain
19	to
20	be
21	specified
22	.

1	What
2	is
3	one
4	to
5	think
6	of
7	all
8	this
9	?

1	Doctrine
2	and
3	special
4	interests
5	govern
6	some
7	responses
8	.

1	People
2	eager
3	to
4	have
5	youth
6	``
7	pay
8	their
9	dues
10	to
11	society
12	''
13	favor
14	service
15	proposals
16	--
17	preferably
18	mandatory
19	ones
20	.

1	So
2	do
3	those
4	who
5	seek
6	a
7	``
8	re-energized
9	concept
10	of
11	citizenship
12	,
13	''
14	a
15	concept
16	imposing
17	stern
18	obligations
19	as
20	well
21	as
22	conferring
23	rights
24	.

1	Then
2	there
3	are
4	instinctive
5	opponents
6	.

1	To
2	libertarians
3	,
4	mandatory
5	service
6	is
7	an
8	abomination
9	and
10	voluntary
11	systems
12	are
13	illegitimate
14	uses
15	of
16	tax
17	money
18	.

1	Devotees
2	of
3	the
4	market
5	question
6	the
7	value
8	of
9	the
10	work
11	national
12	service
13	would
14	perform
15	:

1	If
2	the
3	market
4	wo
5	n't
6	pay
7	for
8	it
9	,
10	they
11	argue
12	,
13	it
14	ca
15	n't
16	be
17	worth
18	its
19	cost
20	.

1	Elements
2	of
3	the
4	left
5	are
6	also
7	reflexively
8	opposed
9	;
10	they
11	see
12	service
13	as
14	a
15	cover
16	for
17	the
18	draft
19	,
20	or
21	fear
22	the
23	regimentation
24	of
25	youth
26	,
27	or
28	want
29	to
30	see
31	rights
32	enlarged
33	,
34	not
35	obligations
36	.

1	But
2	what
3	about
4	those
5	of
6	us
7	whose
8	views
9	are
10	not
11	predetermined
12	by
13	formula
14	or
15	ideology
16	?

1	How
2	should
3	we
4	think
5	about
6	national
7	service
8	?

1	Let
2	's
3	begin
4	by
5	recognizing
6	a
7	main
8	source
9	of
10	confusion
11	--
12	``
13	national
14	service
15	''
16	has
17	no
18	agreed
19	meaning
20	.

1	Would
2	service
3	be
4	voluntary
5	or
6	compulsory
7	?

1	Short
2	or
3	long
4	?

1	Part-time
2	or
3	full-time
4	?

1	Paid
2	or
3	unpaid
4	?

1	Would
2	participants
3	live
4	at
5	home
6	and
7	work
8	nearby
9	or
10	live
11	in
12	barracks
13	and
14	work
15	on
16	public
17	lands
18	?

1	What
2	kinds
3	of
4	work
5	would
6	they
7	do
8	?

1	What
2	does
3	``
4	national
5	''
6	mean
7	?

1	Would
2	the
3	program
4	be
5	run
6	by
7	the
8	federal
9	government
10	,
11	by
12	local
13	governments
14	,
15	or
16	by
17	private
18	voluntary
19	organizations
20	?

1	And
2	who
3	would
4	serve
5	?

1	Only
2	males
3	,
4	as
5	with
6	the
7	draft
8	,
9	or
10	both
11	sexes
12	?

1	Youth
2	only
3	or
4	all
5	ages
6	?

1	Middle-class
2	people
3	,
4	or
5	poor
6	people
7	,
8	or
9	a
10	genuine
11	cross-section
12	?

1	Many
2	or
3	few
4	?

1	Those
2	are
3	not
4	trivial
5	questions
6	,
7	and
8	the
9	label
10	``
11	national
12	service
13	''
14	answers
15	none
16	of
17	them
18	.

1	Then
2	how
3	should
4	we
5	think
6	about
7	national
8	service
9	?

1	As
2	a
3	starting
4	point
5	,
6	here
7	are
8	five
9	propositions
10	:
11	1
12	.
13	Consider
14	the
15	ingredients
16	,
17	not
18	the
19	name
20	.

1	Ignore
2	``
3	national
4	service
5	''
6	in
7	the
8	abstract
9	;
10	consider
11	specific
12	proposals
13	.

1	They
2	will
3	differ
4	in
5	crucial
6	ways
7	.

1	2
2	.
3	``
4	Service
5	''
6	should
7	be
8	service
9	.

1	As
2	commonly
3	understood
4	,
5	service
6	implies
7	sacrifice
8	.

1	It
2	involves
3	accepting
4	risk
5	,
6	or
7	giving
8	up
9	income
10	,
11	or
12	deferring
13	a
14	career
15	.

1	It
2	follows
3	that
4	proposals
5	like
6	Nunn-McCurdy
7	,
8	whose
9	benefits
10	to
11	enrollees
12	are
13	worth
14	some
15	$
16	17,500
17	a
18	year
19	,
20	do
21	not
22	qualify
23	.

1	There
2	is
3	a
4	rationale
5	for
6	such
7	bills
8	:
9	Federal
10	subsidies
11	to

2	is
3	also
4	unwise
5	and

9	the

3	Good

1	Enthusiasts

3	that

5	service
6	would
7	get
8	important
9	work
10	done
11	cheaply
12	:

19	,
20	students
21	tutored

26	.

1	There
2	is
3	important
4	work
5	to
6	be
7	done
8	,
9	and
10	existing
11	service
12	and
13	conservation
14	corps
15	have
16	shown
17	that
18	even
19	youths
20	who
21	start
22	with
23	few
24	skills
25	can
26	do
27	much
28	of
29	it
30	well
31	--
32	but
33	not
34	cheaply
35	.

1	Good
2	service
3	programs
4	require
5	recruitment
6	,
7	screening
8	,
9	training
10	and
11	supervision
12	--
13	all
14	of
15	high
16	quality
17	.

1	They
2	involve
3	stipends
4	to
5	participants
6	.

1	Full-time
2	residential
3	programs
4	also
5	require
6	housing
7	and
8	full-time
9	supervision
10	;
11	they
12	are
13	particularly
14	expensive
15	--
16	more
17	per
18	participant
19	than
20	a
21	year
22	at
23	Stanford
24	or
25	Yale
26	.

1	Non-residential
2	programs
3	are
4	cheaper
5	,
6	but
7	good
8	ones
9	still
10	come
11	to
12	some
13	$
14	10,000
15	a
16	year
17	.

1	Are
2	they
3	worth

1	Evaluations

3	that
4	good
5	ones
6	are
7	--
8	especially
9	so
10	if
11	the
12	effects
13	on
14	participants
15	are
16	counted
17	.

1	But
2	the
3	calculations
4	are
5	challengeable
6	.

1	5
2	.
3	Underclass
4	youth
5	are
6	a
7	special
8	concern
9	.

1	Are
2	such
3	expenditures
4	worthwhile
5	,
6	then
7	?

1	Yes
2	,
3	if
4	targeted
5	.

1	People
2	of
3	all
4	ages
5	and
6	all
7	classes
8	should
9	be
10	encouraged
11	to
12	serve
13	,
14	but
15	there
16	are
17	many
18	ways
19	for
20	middle-class
21	kids
22	,
23	and
24	their
25	elders
26	,
27	to
28	serve
29	at
30	little
31	public
32	cost
33	.

1	They
2	can
3	volunteer
4	at
5	any
6	of
7	thousands
8	of
9	non-profit
10	institutions
11	,
12	or
13	participate
14	in

17	required
18	by
19	high
20	schools
21	or
22	encouraged
23	by
24	colleges
25	or
26	employers
27	.

1	Underclass
2	youth
3	do
4	n't
5	have
6	those
7	opportunities
8	.

1	They
2	are
3	not
4	enrolled
5	in
6	high
7	school
8	or
9	college
10	.

1	They
2	are
3	unlikely
4	to
5	be
6	employed
7	.

1	And
2	they
3	have
4	grown
5	up
6	in
7	unprecedentedly
8	grim
9	circumstances
10	,
11	among
12	family
13	structures
14	breaking
15	down
16	,
17	surrounded
18	by
19	self-destructive
20	behaviors
21	and
22	bleak
23	prospects
24	.

1	But
2	many
3	of
4	them
5	can
6	be
7	quite
8	profoundly
9	reoriented
10	by
11	productive
12	and
13	disciplined
14	service
15	.

1	Some
2	wo
3	n't
4	accept
5	the
6	discipline
7	;
8	others
9	drop
10	out
11	for
12	other
13	reasons
14	.

1	But
2	some
3	whom
4	nothing
5	else
6	is
7	reaching
8	are
9	transformed
10	.

1	Learning
2	skills
3	,
4	producing
5	something
6	cooperatively
7	,
8	feeling
9	useful
10	,
11	they
12	are
13	no
14	longer
15	dependent
16	--
17	others
18	now
19	depend
20	on
21	them
22	.

1	Even
2	if
3	it
4	is
5	cheaper
6	to
7	build
8	playgrounds
9	or
10	paint
11	apartments
12	or
13	plant
14	dune-grass
15	with
16	paid
17	professionals
18	,
19	the
20	effects
21	on
22	the
23	young
24	people
25	providing
26	those
27	services
28	alter
29	the
30	calculation
31	.

1	Strictly
2	speaking
3	,
4	these
5	youth
6	are
7	not
8	performing
9	service
10	.

1	They
2	are
3	giving
4	up
5	no
6	income
7	,
8	deferring
9	no
10	careers
11	,
12	incurring
13	no
14	risk
15	.

1	But
2	they
3	believe
4	themselves
5	to
6	be
7	serving
8	,
9	and
10	they
11	begin
12	to
13	respect
14	themselves
15	(
16	and
17	others
18	)
19	,
20	to
21	take
22	control
23	of
24	their
25	lives
26	,
27	to
28	think
29	of
30	the
31	future
32	.

1	That
2	is
3	a
4	service
5	to
6	the
7	nation
8	.

1	It
2	is
3	what
4	federal
5	support
6	should
7	try
8	hardest
9	to
10	achieve

24	of
25	their
26	way
27	to
28	keep
29	their
30	moves
31	quiet
32	.

1	Federal
2	Reserve
3	Chairman
4	Alan
5	Greenspan
6	was
7	on
8	the
9	telephones
10	,
11	making
12	it
13	clear
14	to
15	officials
16	in
17	the
18	U.S.
19	and
20	abroad
21	that
22	the
23	Fed
24	was
25	prepared
26	to
27	inject
28	massive
29	amounts
30	of
31	money
32	into
33	the
34	banking
35	system
36	,
37	as
38	it
39	did
40	in
41	October
42	1987
43	,
44	if
45	the
46	action
47	were
48	needed
49	to
50	prevent
51	a
52	financial
53	crisis
54	.

1	And
2	at
3	the
4	Treasury
5	,
6	Secretary
7	Nicholas
8	Brady
9	talked
10	with
11	friends
12	and
13	associates
14	on
15	Wall
16	Street
17	while
18	Assistant
19	Secretary
20	David
21	Mullins
22	carefully
23	analyzed
24	data
25	on
26	the
27	Friday
28	market

30	.

1	But
2	the
3	officials
4	feared
5	that
6	any
7	public
8	announcements
9	would
10	only
11	increase
12	market
13	jitters
14	.

1	In

4	officials
5	at
6	the
7	Fed
8	and
9	in
10	the
11	Bush
12	administration
13	decided
14	that
15	avoiding
16	overt
17	actions
18	and
19	statements
20	over
21	the
22	weekend
23	would
24	give

27	strength
28	and

30	should
31	Friday

33	market

35	turn
36	into

1	``
2	The
3	disadvantage

29	said
30	one
31	government
32	official
33	,
34	insisting
35	on
36	anonymity
37	.

1	The
2	Fed
3	's
4	efforts
5	at
6	secrecy
7	were
8	partly
9	foiled
10	Sunday
11	morning
12	,
13	when
14	both
15	the
16	New
17	York
18	Times
19	and
20	the
21	Washington
22	Post
23	carried
24	stories
25	quoting
26	a
27	senior
28	Fed
29	official
30	saying
31	the
32	central
33	bank
34	was
35	prepared
36	to
37	pour
38	cash
39	into
40	the
41	banking
42	system
43	Monday
44	morning
45	.

1	Fed
2	Chairman
3	Greenspan
4	was
5	surprised
6	by
7	both
8	stories
9	,
10	according
11	to
12	knowledgeable
13	sources
14	,
15	and
16	insisted

18	had
19	n't
20	authorized
21	any
22	public
23	comment
24	.

1	Nevertheless
2	,
3	Fed
4	officials
5	acknowledged
6	the
7	stories
8	were
9	reasonably
10	accurate
11	portrayals
12	of
13	the
14	central
15	bank
16	's
17	game

19	.

1	It
2	is
3	prepared
4	to
5	assume
6	the
7	same
8	role
9	it
10	played
11	in
12	October
13	1987
14	,
15	providing
16	money
17	to
18	the
19	markets
20	if
21	necessary
22	to
23	keep
24	the
25	financial
26	system
27	afloat
28	.

1	The
2	Fed
3	provides
4	money
5	to

8	system
9	by
10	buying
11	government
12	securities

1	The
2	reticence
3	of

6	was
7	evident

1	That

3	the

7	investment
8	professionals
9	after
10	Friday
11	's
12	190-point
13	drop
14	in
15	the
16	Dow
17	Jones
18	Industrial

1	No
2	one
3	can

6	sure
7	what
8	will
9	happen
10	today

1	And

4	are
5	divided

11	well
12	or
13	badly
14	in
15	the
16	next
17	six
18	months
19	.

1	But
2	they
3	're
4	nearly
5	unanimous
6	on
7	one
8	point
9	:
10	Do
11	n't
12	sell
13	into
14	a
15	panic
16	.

1	Investors
2	who
3	sold
4	everything
5	after
6	the
7	crash
8	of
9	1987
10	lived
11	to

13	it
14	.

1	Even
2	after
3	Friday
4	's
5	plunge
6	,
7	the
8	Dow
9	Jones
10	Industrial
11	Average
12	was
13	48
14	%
15	above
16	where
17	it
18	landed
19	on
20	Oct.
21	19
22	two
23	years
24	ago
25	.

1	Panic
2	selling
3	also
4	was
5	unwise
6	during
7	other
8	big
9	declines
10	in
11	the
12	past
13	.

1	The
2	crash
3	of
4	1929
5	was
6	followed
7	by
8	a
9	substantial
10	recovery
11	before
12	the
13	great
14	Depression
15	and
16	awful

20	the
21	1930s

1	The
2	``
3	October
4	massacres
5	''
6	of
7	1978
8	and
9	1979
10	were
11	scary
12	,
13	but
14	did
15	n't
16	lead
17	to
18	severe
19	or
20	sustained
21	downturns
22	.

1	Indeed
2	,
3	some

6	Friday
7	's
8	plunge

14	that
15	might
16	occur
17	early
18	this
19	week
20	,
21	as
22	a
23	chance
24	for
25	bargain
26	hunting
27	.

1	``
2	There

4	been

10	that
11	presents

13	nice
14	buying

35	back

38	sell

40	gradually
41	during

43	.

1	Other
2	investment
3	pros
4	are
5	more
6	pessimistic
7	.

1	They
2	say
3	investors
4	should
5	sell
6	stocks
7	--
8	but
9	not
10	necessarily
11	right
12	away
13	.

1	Many
2	of
3	them
4	stress
5	that
6	the
7	selling
8	can
9	be
10	orderly
11	,
12	gradual
13	,
14	and
15	done

1	On

3	,
4	William
5	Fleckenstein
6	,
7	a
8	Seattle
9	money
10	manager
11	,
12	used
13	futures
14	contracts
15	in
16	his
17	personal
18	account
19	to
20	place
21	a
22	bet
23	that
24	the
25	broad
26	market
27	averages
28	would
29	decline
30	.

1	He
2	thinks
3	the
4	underlying
5	inflation
6	rate
7	is
8	around
9	5
10	%
11	to
12	6
13	%
14	,
15	far
16	higher
17	than
18	most

7	,
8	Mr.
9	Fleckenstein
10	has
11	raised
12	cash
13	positions
14	and
15	invested
16	in
17	gold
18	and
19	natural
20	gas
21	stocks
22	,
23	partly
24	as
25	an
26	inflation
27	hedge
28	.

1	He
2	thinks
3	government
4	officials
5	are
6	terrified
7	to
8	let
9	a
10	recession
11	start
12	when
13	government
14	,
15	corporate
16	and
17	personal
18	debt
19	levels
20	are
21	so
22	high
23	.

1	So
2	he
3	thinks
4	the
5	government
6	will
7	err
8	on
9	the
10	side
11	of
12	rekindled
13	inflation

1	As
2	a

4	,
5	Mr.

9	``

19	and

1	He
2	says
3	the
4	Oct.
5	6
6	employment
7	report
8	,
9	showing
10	slower
11	economic
12	growth
13	and
14	a
15	severe
16	weakening
17	in
18	the
19	manufacturing
20	sector
21	,
22	is
23	a
24	warning
25	sign
26	to
27	investors
28	.

1	One
2	strategy
3	for
4	investors
5	who
6	want
7	to
8	stay
9	in
10	but
11	hedge
12	their
13	bets
14	is
15	to
16	buy
17	``
18	put
19	''
20	options
21	,
22	either
23	on
24	the
25	individual
26	stocks
27	they
28	own
29	or
30	on
31	a
32	broad
33	market
34	index
35	.

1	A
2	put
3	option
4	gives
5	its
6	holder
7	the
8	right
9	(
10	but
11	not
12	the
13	obligation
14	)
15	to
16	sell
17	a
18	stock
19	(
20	or
21	stock
22	index
23	)
24	for
25	a
26	specified
27	price
28	(
29	the
30	strike
31	price
32	)
33	until
34	the
35	option
36	expires
37	.

1	Whether
2	this
3	insurance
4	is
5	worthwhile
6	depends
7	on
8	the
9	cost
10	of
11	an
12	option
13	.

1	The
2	cost
3	,
4	or
5	premium
6	,
7	tends
8	to
9	get
10	fat
11	in
12	times
13	of
14	crisis
15	.

1	Thus
2	,
3	buying
4	puts
5	after
6	a
7	big
8	market
9	slide
10	can
11	be
12	an
13	expensive
14	way
15	to
16	hedge
17	against
18	risk
19	.

1	The
2	prices
3	of
4	puts
5	generally
6	did
7	n't
8	soar
9	Friday
10	.

1	For
2	example
3	,
4	the
5	premium
6	as
7	a
8	percentage
9	of
10	the
11	stock
12	price
13	for
14	certain
15	puts
16	on
17	Eli
18	Lilly
19	&
20	Co.
21	moved
22	up
23	from
24	3
25	%
26	at
27	Thursday
28	's
29	close
30	to
31	only
32	3.3
33	%
34	at
35	Friday
36	's
37	close
38	,
39	even
40	though
41	the
42	shares
43	dropped
44	more
45	than
46	$
47	5.50
48	.

1	But
2	put-option
3	prices
4	may
5	zoom
6	when
7	trading
8	resumes
9	today
10	.

1	It
2	's
3	hard
4	to
5	generalize
6	about
7	a
8	reasonable
9	price
10	for
11	puts
12	.

1	But
2	investors
3	should
4	keep
5	in
6	mind
7	,
8	before
9	paying
10	too
11	much
12	,
13	that
14	the
15	average
16	annual
17	return
18	for
19	stock
20	holdings
21	,
22	long-term
23	,
24	is
25	9
26	%
27	to
28	10
29	%
30	a
31	year
32	;
33	a
34	return
35	of
36	15
37	%
38	is
39	considered
40	praiseworthy
41	.

1	Paying
2	,
3	say
4	,
5	10
6	%
7	for
8	insurance
9	against
10	losses
11	takes
12	a
13	deep
14	bite
15	out
16	of
17	the
18	return
19	.

5	this
6	morning
7	in
8	U.S.
9	stock
10	and
11	futures
12	trading
13	may
14	be
15	a
16	pause
17	at
18	the
19	Chicago
20	Mercantile
21	Exchange
22	.

1	Under
2	a
3	reform
4	arising
5	from
6	the
7	1987
8	crash
9	,
10	trading
11	in
12	the
13	Merc
14	's

23	the

27	stays
28	five
29	points
30	from
31	Friday
32	's
33	close

39	40
40	points
41	on
42	the
43	Dow
44	Jones
45	Industrial
46	Average
47	.

1	The
2	aim
3	of
4	the
5	interruption
6	would
7	be
8	to
9	ease
10	the
11	opening
12	of
13	the
14	New
15	York
16	Stock
17	Exchange
18	,
19	which
20	would
21	be
22	hammered
23	by
24	such
25	a
26	volatile
27	move
28	on
29	the
30	Merc
31	.

1	That
2	early-morning
3	breather
4	is
5	just
6	one
7	of
8	a
9	number
10	of
11	safeguards
12	adopted
13	after
14	the
15	1987
16	crash
17	.

1	The
2	Big
3	Board
4	also
5	added
6	computer
7	capacity
8	to
9	handle
10	huge
11	surges
12	in
13	trading
14	volume
15	.

1	Several
2	of
3	those
4	post-crash
5	changes
6	kicked
7	in
8	during
9	Friday
10	's
11	one-hour
12	collapse
13	and
14	worked
15	as
16	expected
17	,
18	even
19	though
20	they
21	did
22	n't
23	prevent
24	a
25	stunning
26	plunge
27	.

1	But
2	the
3	major
4	``
5	circuit
6	breakers
7	''
8	have
9	yet
10	to
11	be
12	evaluated
13	.

1	A
2	deeper
3	market
4	plunge
5	today
6	could
7	give
8	them
9	their
10	first
11	test
12	.

1	A
2	further
3	slide
4	also
5	would
6	resurrect
7	debate
8	over
9	a
10	host
11	of
12	other
13	,
14	more
15	sweeping
16	changes
17	proposed
18	--
19	but
20	not
21	implemented
22	--
23	after
24	the
25	last
26	crash
27	.

1	Most
2	notably
3	,
4	several
5	of
6	the
7	regulatory
8	steps
9	recommended
10	by
11	the
12	Brady
13	Task
14	Force
15	,
16	which
17	analyzed
18	the
19	1987
20	crash
21	,
22	would
23	be
24	revived
25	--
26	especially
27	because
28	that
29	group
30	's
31	chairman
32	is
33	now
34	the
35	Treasury
36	secretary
37	.

1	The
2	most
3	controversial
4	of
5	the
6	Brady
7	recommendations
8	involved
9	establishing
10	a
11	single
12	overarching
13	regulator
14	to
15	handle
16	crucial
17	cross-market
18	questions

26	for
27	the
28	stock
29	and
30	futures
31	markets
32	.

1	But
2	for
3	the
4	moment
5	,
6	attention
7	focuses
8	on
9	the
10	reforms
11	that
12	were
13	put

9	a
10	major
11	cause

1	The
2	process
3	of
4	post-crash
5	reforms
6	began
7	with
8	calls
9	to
10	remake
11	the
12	markets
13	and
14	wound
15	up
16	a
17	year
18	later
19	with
20	a
21	series
22	of
23	rather
24	technical
25	adjustments

1	In

3	1987

22	the

1	Over

4	year
5	that
6	grand
7	agenda
8	was
9	whittled
10	down
11	to

13	series
14	of
15	steps
16	to
17	soften
18	big

5	were
6	placed

13	much
14	discussed

16	little
17	understood

1	And
2	there
3	was
4	much
5	criticism

7	the

1	Still
2	,
3	the
4	consensus
5	seems
6	almost
7	as
8	wide
9	that
10	one
11	faltering

7	,
8	after

11	is
12	directly

1	And

3	expectations
4	clearly

6	been

12	victory
13	in
14	the

16	last

1	An
2	hour
3	before
4	Friday
5	's
6	plunge
7	,
8	that
9	provision
10	was
11	stripped
12	from
13	the
14	tax
15	bill
16	,
17	leaving
18	it
19	with

22	billion
23	in
24	tax
25	increases
26	without
27	a
28	capital
29	gains
30	cut
31	.

1	There
2	is
3	a
4	great
5	deal
6	to
7	be
8	said
9	,
10	to
11	be
12	sure
13	,
14	for
15	stripping
16	the
17	garbage
18	out
19	of
20	the
21	reconciliation
22	bill
23	.

1	It
2	would
3	be
4	a
5	good
6	thing
7	if
8	Congress
9	started
10	to
11	decide
12	issues
13	one-by-one
14	on
15	their

18	without
19	trickery
20	.

1	For
2	one
3	thing
4	,
5	no
6	one
7	doubts
8	that
9	the
10	capital

12	cut
13	would
14	pass
15	on
16	an
17	up-or-down
18	vote
19	.

1	Since
2	Senate
3	leaders
4	have
5	so
6	far
7	fogged
8	it
9	up
10	with
11	procedural
12	smokescreens
13	,
14	promises
15	of
16	a
17	cleaner
18	bill
19	are
20	suspect
21	.

1	Especially
2	so
3	since
4	President
5	Bush
6	has
7	been
8	weakened
9	by
10	the
11	Panama
12	fiasco
13	.

1	To
2	the
3	extent
4	that
5	the
6	UAL
7	troubles
8	contributed
9	to
10	the
11	plunge
12	,
13	they
14	are
15	another
16	instance
17	of
18	Washington
19	's
20	sticky
21	fingers
22	.

1	As
2	the
3	best
4	opportunities
5	for
6	corporate
7	restructurings
8	are
9	exhausted
10	of
11	course
12	,
13	at
14	some
15	point
16	the
17	market
18	will
19	start
20	to
21	reject
22	them
23	.

1	But
2	the
3	airlines
4	are
5	scarcely
6	a
7	clear
8	case
9	,
10	given
11	anti-takeover
12	mischief
13	by
14	Secretary
15	of
16	Transportation
17	Skinner
18	,
19	who
20	professes
21	to
22	believe
23	safety
24	will
25	be
26	compromised
27	if
28	KLM

31	Airways
32	own
33	interests
34	in
35	companies
36	that
37	fly
38	airplanes
39	.

1	Worse
2	,
3	Congress
4	has
5	started
6	to
7	jump
8	on
9	the
10	Skinner
11	bandwagon
12	.

1	James
2	Oberstar
3	,
4	the
5	Minnesota
6	Democrat
7	who
8	chairs
9	the
10	Public
11	Works
12	and
13	Transportation
14	Committee
15	's
16	aviation
17	subcommittee
18	,
19	has
20	put
21	an
22	anti-airline
23	takeover
24	bill
25	on
26	supersonic
27	speed
28	so
29	that
30	it
31	would
32	be
33	passed
34	in

36	to
37	affect
38	the
39	American
40	and
41	United
42	Air
43	Lines
44	bids
45	.

1	It
2	would
3	give
4	Mr.

9	days
10	to
11	``

1	So
2	the
3	UAL
4	deal
5	has
6	problems
7	,
8	and
9	the
10	market
11	loses
12	190
13	points
14	.

1	Congratulations
2	,
3	Mr.
4	Secretary
5	and
6	Mr.
7	Congressman
8	.

1	In
2	the
3	1987
4	crash
5	,
6	remember
7	,
8	the
9	market
10	was
11	shaken
12	by
13	a
14	Danny
15	Rostenkowski
16	proposal
17	to
18	tax
19	takeovers
20	out
21	of
22	existance
23	.

1	Even
2	more
3	important
4	,
5	in
6	our
7	view
8	,
9	was
10	the
11	Treasury
12	's
13	threat
14	to
15	thrash
16	the
17	dollar
18	.

1	The
2	Treasury
3	is
4	doing
5	the
6	same
7	thing
8	today
9	;
10	thankfully
11	,
12	the
13	dollar
14	is
15	not
16	under
17	1987-style
18	pressure
19	.

1	Also
2	,
3	traders
4	are
5	in
6	better
7	shape
8	today
9	than
10	in
11	1987
12	to
13	survive
14	selling
15	binges
16	.

1	They
2	are
3	better
4	capitalized
5	.

1	They
2	are
3	in
4	less
5	danger
6	of
7	losing
8	liquidity
9	simply
10	because
11	of
12	tape
13	lags
14	and
15	clearing
16	and
17	settlement
18	delays
19	.

1	The
2	Fed
3	promises
4	any
5	needed
6	liquidity
7	.

1	The
2	Big
3	Board
4	's
5	liaison
6	with
7	the
8	Chicago
9	Board
10	of
11	Trade
12	has
13	improved
14	;
15	it
16	will
17	be
18	interesting
19	to
20	learn
21	if
22	``
23	circuit
24	breakers
25	''
26	prove
27	to
28	be
29	a
30	good
31	idea
32	.

1	In
2	any
3	event
4	,
5	some
6	traders
7	see
8	stocks
9	as
10	underpriced
11	today
12	,
13	unlike
14	1987
15	.

1	There
2	is
3	nothing
4	wrong
5	with
6	the
7	market
8	that
9	ca
10	n't
11	be
12	cured
13	by
14	a
15	little
16	coherence
17	and
18	common
19	sense
20	in
21	Washington
22	.

1	But
2	on
3	the
4	bearish
5	side
6	,
7	that
8	may
9	be
10	too
11	much
12	to
13	expect
14	.

33	there
34	is

36	one
37	bright
38	sign
39	:
40	The
41	scandals

43	encircling
44	former
45	Prime
46	Minister
47	Andreas
48	Papandreou

12	,
13	in

15	,
16	little
17	more
18	than
19	the

1	The
2	unifying
3	bond
4	for
5	this
6	left-right
7	mismatch

18	as
19	common

1	The

10	,
11	purportedly
12	at

54	.

1	Mr.
2	Koskotas
3	's
4	credibility
5	is
6	,
7	at
8	best
9	,
10	problematic
11	.

1	He
2	has
3	ample
4	motive
5	to
6	shift
7	the
8	blame
9	,
10	and
11	his
12	testimony
13	has
14	also
15	been
16	found
17	less
18	than
19	forthright
20	on
21	numerous
22	points
23	.

1	Nevertheless
2	,
3	the
4	New
5	Democracy
6	and
7	Communist
8	parties
9	herald
10	his
11	assertions
12	as
13	proof
14	of
15	PASOK
16	complicity
17	.

1	Among
2	unanswered
3	questions
4	are
5	whether
6	Mr.
7	Papandreou
8	received
9	$
10	23
11	million
12	of
13	stolen
14	Bank
15	of
16	Crete
17	funds
18	and
19	an
20	additional
21	$
22	734,000
23	in
24	bribes
25	,
26	as
27	contended
28	;
29	whether
30	the
31	prime
32	minister
33	ordered
34	state
35	agencies
36	to
37	deposit
38	some
39	$
40	57
41	million
42	in
43	Mr.
44	Koskotas
45	's
46	bank
47	and
48	then
49	skim
50	off
51	the
52	interest
53	;
54	and
55	,
56	what
57	PASOK
58	's
59	cut
60	was
61	from
62	the
63	$
64	210
65	million
66	Mr.
67	Koskotas
68	pinched
69	.

1	Two
2	former
3	ministers
4	were
5	so
6	heavily
7	implicated
8	in
9	the
10	Koskotas
11	affair
12	that
13	PASOK
14	members
15	of
16	Parliament
17	voted
18	to
19	refer
20	them
21	to
22	the
23	special
24	court
25	.

1	But
2	eluding
3	parliamentary
4	probe
5	was
6	the
7	case
8	of
9	millions
10	of
11	drachmas
12	Mr.
13	Koskotas
14	funneled
15	into
16	New
17	Democracy
18	coffers
19	.

1	In
2	the
3	end
4	,
5	the
6	investigation
7	produced
8	only
9	circumstantial
10	evidence
11	and
12	``
13	indications
14	''
15	that
16	point
17	to
18	PASOK
19	,
20	not
21	clinching
22	proof
23	.

1	On
2	another
3	issue
4	,
5	Greeks
6	were
7	told
8	how
9	their
10	national
11	intelligence
12	agency
13	,
14	the
15	EYP
16	,
17	regularly
18	monitored
19	the
20	telephone
21	conversations
22	of
23	prominent
24	figures
25	,
26	including
27	key
28	opposition
29	politicians
30	,
31	journalists
32	and
33	PASOK
34	cabinet
35	members
36	.

1	Despite
2	convincing
3	arguments
4	,
5	it
6	was
7	never
8	established
9	that
10	Mr.
11	Papandreou
12	personally
13	ordered
14	or
15	directed
16	the
17	wiretaps
18	.

1	The
2	central
3	weakness
4	of
5	the
6	``
7	scandals
8	''
9	debates
10	was
11	pointed
12	up
13	especially
14	well
15	when
16	discussions
17	focused
18	on
19	arms
20	deals
21	and
22	kickbacks
23	.

1	The
2	coalition
3	government
4	tried
5	to
6	show
7	that
8	PASOK
9	ministers
10	had
11	received
12	hefty
13	sums
14	for
15	OKing
16	the
17	purchase
18	of
19	F-16
20	Fighting
21	Falcon
22	and
23	Mirage
24	2000
25	combat
26	aircraft
27	,
28	produced
29	by
30	the
31	U.S.based
32	General
33	Dynamics
34	Corp.
35	and
36	France
37	's
38	Avions
39	Marcel
40	Dassault
41	,
42	respectively
43	.

1	Naturally
2	,
3	neither
4	General
5	Dynamics
6	nor
7	Dassault
8	could
9	be
10	expected
11	to
12	hamper
13	its
14	prospective
15	future
16	dealings
17	by
18	making
19	disclosures
20	of
21	sums
22	paid
23	(
24	or
25	not
26	)
27	to
28	various
29	Greek
30	officials
31	for
32	services
33	rendered
34	.

1	So
2	it
3	seems
4	that
5	Mr.
6	Mitsotakis
7	and
8	his
9	communist
10	chums
11	may
12	have
13	unwittingly
14	served
15	Mr.
16	Papandreou
17	a
18	moral
19	victory
20	on
21	a
22	platter
23	:
24	PASOK
25	,
26	whether
27	guilty
28	or
29	not
30	,
31	can
32	now
33	traipse
34	the
35	countryside
36	condemning
37	the
38	whole
39	affair
40	as
41	a
42	witch
43	hunt
44	at
45	Mr.
46	Papandreou
47	's
48	expense
49	.

1	But
2	while
3	verbal
4	high
5	jinks
6	alone
7	wo
8	n't
9	help
10	PASOK
11	regain
12	power
13	,
14	Mr.
15	Papandreou
16	should
17	never
18	be
19	underestimated
20	.

1	First
2	came
3	his
4	predictable
5	fusillade
6	:
7	He
8	charged
9	the
10	Coalition
11	of
12	the
13	Left
14	and
15	Progress
16	had
17	sold
18	out
19	its
20	leftist
21	tenets
22	by
23	collaborating
24	in
25	a
26	right-wing
27	plot
28	aimed
29	at
30	ousting
31	PASOK
32	and
33	thwarting
34	the
35	course
36	of
37	socialism
38	in
39	Greece
40	.

1	Then
2	,
3	to
4	buttress
5	his
6	credibility
7	with
8	the
9	left
10	,
11	he
12	enticed
13	some
14	smaller
15	leftist
16	parties
17	to
18	stand
19	for
20	election
21	under
22	the
23	PASOK
24	banner
25	.

1	Next
2	,
3	he
4	continued
5	to
6	court
7	the
8	communists
9	--
10	many
11	of
12	whom
13	feel
14	betrayed
15	by
16	the
17	left-right
18	coalition
19	's
20	birth
21	--
22	by
23	bringing
24	into
25	PASOK
26	a
27	well-respected
28	Communist
29	Party
30	candidate
31	.

1	For
2	balance
3	,
4	and
5	in
6	hopes
7	of
8	gaining
9	some
10	disaffected
11	centrist
12	votes
13	,
14	he
15	managed
16	to
17	attract
18	a
19	former
20	New
21	Democracy
22	Party
23	representative
24	and
25	known
26	political
27	enemy
28	of
29	Mr.
30	Mitsotakis
31	.

1	Thus
2	PASOK
3	heads
4	for
5	the
6	polls
7	not
8	only
9	with
10	diminished
11	scandal-stench
12	,
13	but
14	also
15	with
16	``
17	seals
18	of
19	approval
20	''
21	from
22	representatives
23	of
24	its
25	harshest
26	accusers
27	.

1	Crucial
2	as
3	these
4	elections
5	are
6	for
7	Greece
8	,
9	pressing
10	issues
11	of
12	state
13	are
14	getting
15	lost
16	in
17	the
18	shuffle
19	.

1	The
2	country
3	's
4	future
5	NATO
6	participation
7	remains
8	unsure
9	,
10	for
11	instance
12	.

1	Greece
2	also
3	must
4	revamp
5	major
6	pieces
7	of
8	legislation
9	in
10	preparation
11	for
12	the
13	1992
14	targets
15	of
16	heightened
17	Common
18	Market
19	cooperation
20	.

1	Greece
2	's
3	bilateral
4	relations
5	with
6	the
7	U.S.
8	need
9	attention
10	soon
11	as
12	well
13	.

1	For
2	one
3	,
4	the
5	current
6	accord
7	concerning
8	U.S.
9	military
10	bases
11	in
12	Greece
13	lapses
14	in
15	May
16	1990
17	.

1	Negotiations
2	for
3	a
4	new
5	agreement
6	were
7	frozen
8	before
9	the
10	June
11	elections
12	,
13	but
14	the
15	clock
16	is
17	running
18	.

1	Another
2	matter
3	of
4	concern
5	is
6	the
7	extradition
8	of
9	Mohammed
10	Rashid
11	,
12	a
13	Palestinian
14	terrorist
15	who
16	is
17	wanted
18	in
19	the
20	U.S.
21	for
22	the
23	1982
24	bombing
25	of
26	a
27	Pan
28	American
29	Airways
30	flight
31	.

1	The
2	Greek
3	courts
4	have
5	decided
6	in
7	favor
8	of
9	extradition
10	in
11	the
12	Rashid
13	case
14	,
15	but
16	the
17	matter
18	awaits
19	final
20	approval
21	from
22	Greece
23	's
24	next
25	justice
26	minister
27	.

1	The
2	Greeks
3	seem
4	barely
5	aware
6	of
7	the
8	importance
9	of
10	the
11	case
12	as
13	a
14	litmus
15	test
16	of
17	whether
18	Greece
19	will
20	be
21	counted
22	in
23	or
24	out
25	for
26	international
27	efforts
28	to
29	combat
30	terrorism
31	.

1	That
2	PASOK
3	could
4	win
5	the
6	elections
7	outright
8	is
9	improbable
10	;
11	the
12	Greek
13	press
14	,
15	previously
16	eager
17	to
18	palm
19	off
20	PASOK
21	's
22	line
23	,
24	has
25	turned
26	on
27	Mr.
28	Papandreou
29	with
30	a
31	wild-eyed
32	vengeance
33	.

1	Yet
2	the
3	possibility
4	of
5	another
6	lash-up
7	government
8	is
9	all
10	too
11	real
12	.

1	If
2	Mr.
3	Papandreou
4	becomes
5	the
6	major
7	opposition
8	leader
9	,
10	he
11	could
12	hamstring
13	a
14	conservative-led
15	coalition
16	.

1	Also
2	,
3	he
4	could
5	force
6	new
7	elections
8	early
9	next
10	year
11	by
12	frustrating
13	the
14	procedures
15	for
16	the
17	election
18	of
19	the
20	president
21	of
22	the
23	republic
24	in
25	March
26	.

1	New
2	Democracy
3	has
4	once
5	again
6	glaringly
7	underestimated
8	the
9	opponent
10	and
11	linked
12	its
13	own
14	prospects
15	to
16	negative
17	reaction
18	against
19	PASOK
20	,
21	forgetting
22	to
23	tend
24	to
25	either
26	program
27	clarity
28	or
29	the
30	rectification
31	of
32	internal
33	squabbles
34	.

1	As
2	for
3	Mr.
4	Papandreou
5	?

1	He
2	's
3	not
4	exactly
5	sitting
6	pretty
7	at
8	this
9	stage
10	.

1	But
2	since
3	he
4	is
5	undoubtedly
6	one
7	of
8	the
9	most
10	proficient
11	bull
12	slingers
13	who
14	ever
15	raked
16	muck
17	,
18	it
19	seems
20	far
21	wiser
22	to
23	view
24	him
25	as
26	sidelined
27	,
28	but
29	certainly
30	not
31	yet
32	eliminated
33	.

1	Mr.
2	Carpenter
3	,
4	a
5	regional
6	correspondent
7	for
8	National
9	Review
10	,
11	has
12	lived
13	in
14	Athens
15	since
16	1981
17	.

1	U.S.
2	OFFICIALS
3	MOVED
4	to
5	head
6	off
7	any
8	repeat
9	of
10	Black
11	Monday
12	today
13	following
14	Friday
15	's
16	plunge
17	in
18	stock
19	prices
20	.

1	Fed
2	Chairman
3	Greenspan
4	signaled
5	that
6	the
7	central
8	bank
9	was
10	prepared
11	to
12	inject
13	massive
14	amounts
15	of
16	money
17	into
18	the
19	banking
20	system
21	to
22	prevent
23	a
24	financial
25	crisis
26	.

1	Other
2	U.S.
3	and
4	foreign
5	officials
6	also
7	mapped
8	out
9	plans
10	,
11	though
12	they
13	kept
14	their
15	moves
16	quiet
17	to
18	avoid
19	making
20	the
21	financial
22	markets
23	more
24	jittery
25	.

1	Friday
2	's
3	sell-off
4	was
5	triggered
6	by
7	the
8	collapse
9	of
10	UAL
11	's
12	buy-out
13	plan
14	and
15	a
16	big
17	rise
18	in
19	producer
20	prices
21	.

1	The
2	Dow
3	Jones
4	industrials
5	skidded
6	190.58
7	,
8	to
9	2569.26
10	.

1	The
2	junk
3	bond
4	market
5	came
6	to
7	a
8	standstill
9	,
10	while
11	Treasury
12	bonds
13	soared
14	and
15	the
16	dollar
17	fell
18	.

1	Japanese
2	stocks
3	dropped
4	early
5	Monday
6	,
7	but
8	by
9	late
10	morning
11	were
12	turning
13	around
14	.

1	The
2	dollar
3	was
4	trading
5	sharply
6	lower
7	in
8	Tokyo
9	.

1	Prospects
2	for
3	a
4	new
5	UAL
6	buy-out
7	proposal
8	appear
9	bleak
10	.

1	Many
2	banks
3	refused
4	to
5	back
6	the
7	$
8	6.79
9	billion
10	transaction
11	,
12	but
13	bankers
14	said
15	it
16	was
17	not
18	from
19	any
20	unwillingness
21	to
22	finance
23	takeovers
24	.

1	The
2	decision
3	was
4	based
5	solely
6	on
7	problems
8	with
9	the
10	UAL
11	management-pilot
12	plan
13	,
14	they
15	said
16	.

1	The
2	surge
3	in
4	producer
5	prices
6	in
7	September
8	followed
9	three
10	months
11	of
12	declines
13	,
14	but
15	analysts
16	were
17	divided
18	on
19	whether
20	the
21	0.9
22	%
23	jump
24	signaled
25	a
26	severe
27	worsening
28	of
29	inflation
30	.

1	Also
2	,
3	retail
4	sales
5	grew
6	0.5
7	%
8	last
9	month
10	.

1	A

8	filed
9	by

27	the
28	Lisa
29	computer
30	,
31	introduced
32	in

34	.

1	Lawyers
2	specializing
3	in
4	shareholder
5	suits
6	said
7	they
8	are

21	become
22	popular
23	as
24	a
25	result
26	of
27	the
28	ruling
29	.

1	According
2	to
3	the
4	suit
5	,
6	Apple
7	officials
8	created
9	public
10	excitement
11	by
12	touting
13	Lisa
14	as
15	an
16	office
17	computer
18	that
19	would
20	revolutionize
21	the
22	workplace
23	and
24	be
25	extremely
26	successful
27	in
28	its
29	first
30	year
31	.

1	The
2	plaintiffs
3	also
4	alleged
5	that
6	prior
7	to
8	the
9	fanfare
10	,
11	the
12	company
13	circulated
14	internal
15	memos
16	indicating
17	problems
18	with
19	Lisa
20	.

1	The
2	suit

4	Apple
5	's
6	stock
7	climbed

14	a

16	on

18	basis
19	of
20	the
21	company
22	's
23	optimistic
24	forecasts
25	.

1	But
2	when
3	the

5	revealed
6	Lisa
7	's
8	poor
9	sales
10	late
11	in
12	1983
13	,
14	the

16	plummeted

19	low
20	of
21	$
22	17.37
23	a
24	share
25	,
26	according
27	to

30	.

1	The
2	shareholders
3	claimed
4	more
5	than
6	$
7	150
8	million
9	in
10	losses
11	.

1	In
2	1987
3	,
4	the
5	San
6	Francisco
7	district
8	court
9	dismissed
10	the
11	case
12	largely
13	because
14	newspaper
15	reports
16	had
17	sufficiently
18	counterbalanced
19	the
20	company
21	's
22	statements
23	by
24	alerting
25	consumers
26	to
27	Lisa
28	's
29	problems
30	.

1	Late
2	last
3	month
4	,
5	the
6	appeals
7	court
8	agreed
9	that
10	most
11	of
12	the
13	case
14	should
15	be
16	dismissed
17	.

1	However
2	,
3	it
4	gave
5	the
6	shareholders
7	the
8	right
9	to
10	pursue
11	a
12	small
13	portion
14	of
15	their
16	claim
17	that
18	pertains

20	Lisa
21	's
22	disk
23	drive
24	,
25	known
26	as
27	Twiggy
28	.

1	The
2	court
3	ruled
4	that
5	the
6	news
7	media
8	did
9	n't
10	reveal
11	Twiggy
12	's
13	problems
14	at

8	implication
9	in

1	The

7	does
8	n't
9	mean
10	the

1	Suitors

1	This

3	an
4	ominous

6	for

19	the
20	troubles
21	of
22	the

12	from
13	a

1	Specifically

1	As

4	the

14	(
15	the

1	The

14	of

18	,
19	and

23	in

1	Also
2	,
3	concern

20	.

1	They
2	say
3	China
4	's
5	trade
6	deficit
7	is
8	widening

10	the

1	He
2	also
3	argued
4	that
5	the
6	high
7	court
8	was
9	wrong
10	in
11	1976
12	to
13	rule
14	that

23	argued
24	and
25	will
26	decide
27	this

29	.

1	The
2	administration
3	filed
4	the
5	brief
6	in
7	an
8	appeal
9	involving
10	a
11	Minnesota
12	law
13	that
14	requires
15	that
16	both

21	be
22	notified
23	before
24	she
25	may
26	have
27	an
28	abortion
29	.

1	The
2	administration
3	urged
4	the
5	justices
6	to
7	adopt
8	a
9	legal
10	standard
11	suggested
12	by
13	Chief
14	Justice
15	William
16	Rehnquist
17	last
18	July
19	when
20	the
21	high
22	court
23	upheld
24	Missouri
25	's
26	abortion
27	restrictions
28	.

1	Under
2	that
3	standard
4	,
5	which
6	garnered
7	the
8	votes
9	of
10	only
11	three
12	of
13	the
14	nine
15	justices
16	,
17	a
18	state
19	restriction
20	of
21	abortion
22	is
23	constitutional
24	if
25	the

28	a
29	``

31	''
32	justification
33	for

1	That

3	a
4	much
5	easier
6	standard
7	for
8	a
9	state
10	to
11	satisfy
12	than
13	the
14	Supreme
15	Court
16	's
17	test
18	since
19	1973
20	,
21	which
22	requires
23	a
24	state
25	to
26	have
27	a
28	``
29	compelling
30	''
31	reason
32	for

3	provisions
4	of
5	the
6	Minnesota
7	law
8	,
9	the

12	said
13	that
14	requiring
15	that

20	is
21	a

20	for
21	comment
22	.

1	With
2	a
3	Qintex
4	deal
5	,
6	NBC
7	would
8	move
9	into
10	uncharted
11	territory
12	--
13	possibly
14	raising
15	hackles
16	at
17	the
18	studios
19	and
20	in
21	Washington
22	.

1	``
2	It
3	's
4	never
5	really
6	been
7	tested
8	,
9	''
10	says
11	William
12	Lilley
13	III
14	,
15	who
16	as
17	a
18	top
19	CBS
20	executive
21	spent
22	years
23	lobbying
24	to
25	have
26	the
27	rules
28	lifted
29	.

1	He
2	now
3	runs
4	Policy
5	Communications
6	in
7	Washington
8	,
9	consulting
10	to
11	media
12	companies
13	.

1	Fin-syn
2	rules
3	do
4	n't
5	explicitly
6	block
7	a
8	network
9	from
10	buying
11	a
12	passive
13	,
14	small
15	stake
16	in
17	a
18	company
19	that
20	profits
21	from
22	the
23	rerun
24	syndication
25	networks
26	ca
27	n't
28	enjoy
29	.

1	Hence
2	,
3	NBC
4	might
5	be
6	able
7	to
8	take
9	,
10	say
11	,
12	a
13	5
14	%
15	stake
16	in
17	a
18	company
19	such
20	as
21	MGM\/UA
22	.

1	If
2	the
3	transaction
4	raised
5	objections
6	,
7	the
8	studio
9	's
10	syndication
11	operations
12	could
13	be
14	spun
15	off
16	into
17	a
18	separate
19	firm
20	in
21	which
22	the
23	network
24	does
25	n't
26	have
27	a
28	direct
29	stake
30	.

1	But
2	such
3	convolutions
4	would
5	still
6	block
7	the
8	networks
9	from
10	grabbing
11	a
12	big
13	chunk
14	of
15	the
16	riches
17	of
18	syndication
19	.

1	Under
2	current
3	rules
4	,
5	even
6	when
7	a
8	network
9	fares
10	well
11	with
12	a
13	100%-owned
14	series
15	--
16	ABC
17	,
18	for
19	example
20	,
21	made
22	a
23	killing
24	in
25	broadcasting
26	its
27	popular
28	crime\/comedy
29	``
30	Moonlighting
31	''
32	--
33	it
34	is
35	n't
36	allowed
37	to
38	share
39	in
40	the
41	continuing
42	proceeds
43	when
44	the
45	reruns
46	are
47	sold
48	to
49	local
50	stations
51	.

1	Instead
2	,
3	ABC
4	will
5	have
6	to
7	sell
8	off
9	the
10	rights
11	for
12	a
13	one-time
14	fee
15	.

1	The
2	networks
3	admit
4	that
5	the
6	chances
7	of
8	getting
9	the
10	relief
11	they
12	want
13	are
14	slim
15	--
16	for
17	several
18	years
19	at
20	the
21	least
22	.

1	Six
2	years
3	ago
4	they
5	were
6	tantalizingly
7	close
8	.

1	The
2	Reagan-era
3	Federal
4	Communications
5	Commission
6	had
7	ruled
8	in
9	favor
10	of
11	killing
12	most
13	of
14	the
15	rules
16	.

1	Various
2	evidence

5	a

10	some
11	800

14	the

17	aired
18	and
19	had
20	partly
21	owned
22	in
23	the
24	1960s
25	,
26	showed
27	the

35	a
36	climate
37	of
38	trust
39	and
40	peace
41	in
42	which
43	his

1	But
2	Pretoria
3	may
4	instead
5	be
6	creating
7	a
8	climate
9	for
10	more
11	turmoil
12	and
13	uncertainty
14	in
15	this
16	racially
17	divided
18	country

4	governments
5	,
6	particularly
7	Poland
8	and
9	the
10	Soviet
11	Union

15	discovered
16	,
17	initial
18	steps
19	to

32	difficult
33	,
34	if
35	not
36	impossible
37	,
38	to
39	control
40	.

1	As
2	the
3	days
4	go
5	by
6	,
7	the
8	South
9	African
10	government
11	will
12	be
13	ever
14	more
15	hard
16	pressed
17	to
18	justify
19	the
20	continued
21	imprisonment
22	of
23	Mr.
24	Mandela
25	as
26	well
27	as
28	the
29	continued
30	banning

32	the
33	ANC
34	and
35	enforcement
36	of
37	the

41	.

1	If
2	it
3	does
4	n't
5	yield
6	on
7	these
8	matters
9	,
10	and
11	eventually
12	begin
13	talking
14	directly
15	to
16	the
17	ANC
18	,
19	the
20	expectations
21	and
22	promise
23	raised
24	by
25	yesterday
26	's
27	releases
28	will
29	turn
30	to
31	disillusionment
32	and
33	unrest
34	.

1	If
2	it
3	does
4	,
5	the
6	large
7	number
8	of

13	oppose
14	any
15	concessions
16	to
17	the
18	black
19	majority
20	,
21	will
22	step
23	up
24	their
25	agitation
26	and
27	threats
28	to
29	take
30	matters
31	into
32	their
33	own
34	hands
35	.

1	The
2	newly
3	released
4	ANC
5	leaders
6	also
7	will
8	be
9	under
10	enormous
11	pressure
12	.

1	The
2	government
3	is
4	watching
5	closely
6	to
7	see
8	if
9	their
10	presence
11	in
12	the
13	townships
14	leads
15	to
16	increased
17	anti-government
18	protests
19	and
20	violence
21	;
22	if
23	it
24	does
25	,
26	Pretoria
27	will
28	use
29	this
30	as
31	a
32	reason
33	to
34	keep
35	Mr.
36	Mandela
37	behind
38	bars
39	.

1	Pretoria
2	has
3	n't
4	forgotten
5	why
6	they
7	were
8	all
9	sentenced
10	to
11	life
12	imprisonment
13	in
14	the
15	first
16	place

18	for
19	sabotage
20	and
21	conspiracy
22	to
23	overthrow
24	the
25	government
26	.

1	In
2	addition
3	,
4	the
5	government
6	is
7	figuring
8	that
9	the
10	releases
11	could
12	create
13	a
14	split
15	between
16	the
17	internal
18	and
19	external
20	wings
21	of
22	the
23	ANC
24	and
25	between
26	the
27	newly
28	freed
29	leaders
30	and
31	those

33	who
34	have
35	emerged
36	as
37	leaders
38	inside
39	the
40	country
41	during
42	their
43	imprisonment
44	.

7	divisions
8	,
9	Mr.
10	Mandela
11	,
12	in

15	with
16	his
17	colleagues
18	before
19	they
20	were
21	released
